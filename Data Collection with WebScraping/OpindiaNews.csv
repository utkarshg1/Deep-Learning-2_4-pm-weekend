The announcement was made at the party meeting held in Lucknow on Sunday. The meeting was presided over by Mayawati, and she was accompanied by her nephew Akash Anand. It was called to plan the party’s preparations for the upcoming Lok Sabha 2024 polls. Speaking with ANI about the party meeting, BSP leader Udayveer Singh said, “BSP chief Mayawati has announced Akash Anand as her successor.”#WATCH | Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh | Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Udayveer Singh says, ""BSP chief Mayawati has announced Akash Anand (Mayawati's nephew) as her successor…"" pic.twitter.com/nT1jmAMI29Reacting to the development, BSP UP president Vishwnath Pal said, “The whole ‘Bahujan Samaj’ is happy.”VIDEO | ""The whole 'Bahujan Samaj' is happy,"" says BSP UP president @PalVishwnathbsp in response to a media query on Mayawati declaring her nephew Akash Anand as her successor. pic.twitter.com/8lsYijAcEkNotably, Akash Anand is the son of Mayawati’s younger brother, Anand Kumar. Currently, Akash holds the official position of BSP’s national coordinator. As per his official X account, he describes himself as “A young supporter of Baba Saheb’s vision”.For several years now, he was perceived as the successor of BSP Supremo. It was considered that he would succeed the incumbent BSP Supremo as the party President, as he was also said to be in charge of party affairs since last year. Akash Anand joined the Bahujan Samaj Party in 2016. During the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, he was listed as one of the star campaigners for his party. He held major responsibilities in the recently concluded four state assembly elections, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The party gained success to a considerable extent in holding its support base and secured two seats in Rajasthan.Anand’s visibility within the BSP circle, along with his padayatra in Rajasthan’s Alwar in 2022, elevated his prominence. These reports of his elevation further gained momentum within the party, as they look ahead to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, which are now just five months away.For those unversed, on the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar in 2022, 28-year-old Akash Anand participated in a 13-km “Swabhiman Sankalp Yatra” in Alwar. He was actively involved in BSP’s election campaign in Rajasthan in 2019, rallying support for the Samajwadi Party-BSP-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance.Earlier, he also led the party’s 14-day ‘Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay Sankalp Yatra’. He came into the media spotlight when Mayawati announced the inclusion of her nephew in the Bahujan Samaj Party movement. His debut political rally took place in 2019, where he urged voters to support the Samajwadi Party-BSP-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance. It coincided with a 48-hour campaign ban imposed on Mayawati by the Election Commission.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

My gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continuous guidance in transforming our state,” on social media and the Congress leader picked it as an opportunity to target the state government. By the comment, Karti Chidambaram wanted to imply that it is just a hollow promise and that the plant will not come up in Assam.However, the BJP leaders as well as netizens responded strongly to the attack. The Assam chief minister promised to call him as soon as the plant is established in the state. He tweeted, “Yes. I will. Promise”Yes . I will .

Do mention your skill, I mean, other than being a gardener during the UPA era..Notably, Karti Chidambaram is the son of former Union Finance Minister in the Congress government and current Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram who took a jab at the present government’s ‘Digital India’ campaign in 2017.Interestingly, the senior Chidambaram vehemently criticised the Modi government’s ‘Digital India’ program earlier in 2017 in a speech in Rajya Sabha by claiming that it was impossible to discuss a cashless economy in a rural area. “You go there and the people ask ‘What digital?’ It is very difficult to get away with a lie. The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.”He further charged, “You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money can’t come now, because you breached your promise to them,” arguing that the ambitious initiative of the central administration was bound for a massive failure. Meanwhile, his predictions didn’t come to fruition and with 1,124 crore United Payments Interface (UPI) transactions in November this year, the nation’s digital payments through UPI surpassed the 11 Billion threshold for the second consecutive month. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) released data showing that these transactions were up 54% from the 730.95 crore transactions that the payments network registered in November 2022. Chidambaram had argued that small traders like vegetable sellers will never be able to accept cashless payments, but now every single roadside stall has small boards displaying their QR codes enabling them to receive payments via UPI.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ",‘Jamiat gave you wrong information’: Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demands apology from Kapil Sibal for claiming that Assam was part of Myanmar,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-leader-debabrata-saikia-asks-kapil-sibal-to-apologise-for-claiming-that-assam-was-part-of-myanmar/,"Debabrata Saikia wrote that the incorrect representation of Assam history by Kapil Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam.Days after Senior Supreme Court advocate Kapil Sibal sparked a controversy by claiming that Assam was originally a part of Myanmar, Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demanded an apology for distorting history. The leader of the opposition in Assam has written a letter to former Congress leader Kapil Sibal in this regard.Debabrata Saikia wrote that this incorrect representation of Assam history by Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam. “It seems the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and AAMSU might have provided you with incorrect information about Assam history and your team has failed to cross check the data before presentation,” he wrote. AAMSU stands for All Assam Minority Students’ Union.Assam Congress Legislative Party Leader Debabrata Saikia has written a letter to Kapil Sibal to apologize publicly to people of Assam. Sibal, who was a Union Minister several times during Congress govt, had himself said in Supreme Court that Assam was under Myanmar in the past. pic.twitter.com/L3ypEAEnE7Debabrata Saikia is MLA from Nazira constituency and the son of former Assam chief minister late Hiteshwar Sarikia.Explaining the contention that Assam was part of Myanmar is wrong, the Congress leader wrote, “The history of Assam is the history of a confluence of the Austroasiatic, Tibeto- Burman (Sino-Tibetan), Tai and Indo-Aryan cultures. The Ahom kingdom ruled Assam for six centuries and unified Assam. Although invaded over centuries, it was never a vassal or a colony to an external power until the third Burmese invasion in 1821, and subsequently the British ingress into Assam in 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War. The colonial era began with the establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826.”The Congress leader added, “Therefore, Assam was never a part of Myanmar and this comment from a senior statesman like you have hurt the pride and emotion of indigenous people of Assam.” Asking Kapil Sibal to withdraw the comments made in the Supreme Court, Debabrata Saikia also asked him to issue an apology to the people of Assam for distorting the history of Assam. “In view of this, I request you to kindly withdraw the statement and render a public apology before the public of Assam for mis-representation of Assam’s glorious history,” he wrote.Kapil Sibal made the controversial comments on 7th September in Supreme Court while opposing petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955.The Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 provides a different cut-off date for immigrants to be considered illegal immigrants. As per this, all foreigners who entered Assam on or before 25th March 1971 will be granted Indian citizenship, against the cut-off date of 19th July 1949 for the rest of the country.While arguing against the petitions, Kapil Sibal said that history of Assam is complicated as it was part of Myanmar which was later handed over to the British. Sibal also claimed that migration to Assam can’t be mapped, as ‘no migration can ever be mapped’.Kapil Sibal said in the apex court, “If you look at the history of Assam, it is impossible to figure out who came when. Assam originally was a part of Myanmar, and it was way back in 1824 after the British conquered a part of it. A treaty was entered into and that is how Assam was handed over to the British.”What Sibal said was incorrect, because while the Burmese army occupied Assam for a very brief period of time, that led to the first Anglo-Burma war that ended in 1826, Assam was never a part of Assam. The Treaty of Yandabo was signed between Myanmar and British India after Myanmar lost the war, under which Myanmar ceded control of Assam and Manipur to British government.Before Burma occupied Assam in 1821-1822 that lasted till 1826 during the war, it was never a part of any other country in recorded history. Assam, previously known as Pragjyotishpur and Kamrup, is being ruled by local rulers for thousands of years, and the state, along with neighbouring states, are part of the greater Indian culture from pre-historic times.Earlier Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma slammed Kapil Sibal for the comment, saying that those who do not know history should not make such statements.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"5 December, 2023 ","BJP increases vote share in Telangana but fails to win even as anger brewed against KCR: How it got the chemistry wrong, not mathematics",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-increase-voteshare-telangana-fails-win-anger-kcr-result-analysis/,"The anger against KCR was real. So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023.At one of the pre-2019 meetings in Hyderabad, a BJP karyakarta stood up and asked the leader presiding that meeting – All these years, we have been dancing in front of the party office to celebrate victories in other states. When will we dance at our office to celebrate our victories in our state? The hall reverberated with claps, specifically at the tone and manner in which the question was posed – a tone steeped in anguish yet passionate to put everything at stake so that he could dance for the said reason. For many decades leading up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this dance eluded the karyakarta. Hence the anguish. They saw real hope post-2014. Hence the excitement. The passion was always there. It was the direction that they were looking for. And the karyakartas got their first opportunity to dance when the BJP won an unprecedented 4 Lok Sabha seats for the first time in Telangana. The first step towards the ultimate dream of capturing power in Telangana was made. Bandi Sanjay Kumar was made President of the party. The second step was made. The party won the all-important Dubbaka bye-poll. Third step. The party stormed the GHMC polls in an unprecedented manner. Fourth step. The party President started his padayatra, right from Owaisi’s bastion. He stood right before Charminar and made thousands of karyakartas chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Shree Ram – something people thought was never possible. Yeah yeah – he got “communal” and all that. But you need to know about Owaisi’s bastion to understand the monumental scale of what the karyakarta felt when Bandi Sanjay did what he did, on the day he started his padayatra. Fifth step. A big leap.  KCR fired one of his best lieutenants – Eatata Rajendar. The BJP convinced him to join them. He did and won the all-important Huzurabad bye-election. The stride of the steps was just increasing. The BJP held its national executive in Hyderabad and then held a massive public meeting – the crowd was so huge that the Prime Minister was pleasantly surprised and patted Bandi Sanjay on his back for it. Small gesture, but gave much-needed fuel to continue the pace of the steps being taken for the ultimate goal – power in Telangana in 2023. A Congress MLA resigned and joined the BJP, thus prompting a bye-election. Rahul Gandhi’s famed BJ Yatra was passing through the state when this bye-election was happening. KCR sent 80 of its MLAs to this one constituency to defeat the BJP. Against such strong odds, the BJP still put up a great fight despite losing this seat. A setback but definitely not the end of the road. Mysteriously, very mysteriously, this setback became the end of the road for the BJP’s rise in the state!The karyakarta was flabbergasted when Bandi Sanjay’s term was not extended after his 3-year term ended in March 2023. Yes, missteps were made. The mighty BJP could have easily groomed Bandi Sanjay better when certain issues were being brought to the fore. It is still an abiding mystery why the central unit of the party could not find the right resources to groom a fledgling state unit. It’s not as if this is something new for a party like the BJP. They have tremendous experience and accessibility to resources to handle situations like this. The backlash from the karyakarta at removing Bandi Sanjay from the position wasn’t anticipated by the central unit. I find it very hard to believe though – for a party like the BJP that thrives on feedback, it is tough to believe that they didn’t anticipate this. For a party like the BJP that did what they did in MP and Chhattisgarh, it is indeed a mystery as to why they gave up on Telangana. Yes, we can list out all the missteps the party took in the run-up to the 2023 elections. We can talk about the mathematics of the election. In fact, I started this article to explain the mathematics behind BJP’s loss. Using the below graphic, I wanted to explain how the party that took GHMC by storm in 2020 has failed woefully in 2023 in the exact same area. I wanted to refer to the increase in overall vote percentage for the party; the victory in the northern areas of Telangana etc. And then I read this beautiful post written by a Twitter handle – Gems of KCR. This is when it dawned upon me that the BJP lost this election because it faltered on chemistry, not on the mathematics of the election. Who is the person behind GemsOfKCR?I'm a common man, hailing from a humble family background from rural Telangana, fought for my village's issues. In 2016 questioned BRS MLA in public and asked him to solve my village problem. He has promised to solve but he didn't.Instead of…The anger against KCR was real (we explained in multiple articles here on OpIndia why people are angry). So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023. This election is BJP’s loss more than the Congress’s victory (not to take away credit, but Congress’s rise only coincided with BJP’s downfall). The karyakarta who wanted to dance the ultimate step in 2023 will now have to wait till for 2028 for the next chance. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"5 December, 2023 ","Lies, falsehoods, and blatant propaganda: Bloomberg article by Ruth Pollard is a symphony of seething and coping after BJP’s electoral victory in 3 states",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/lies-propaganda-bloomberg-article-ruth-pollard-after-bjps-electoral-victory-in-3-states-modi/,"Pollard forgets that the partners of the Indo-Pacific Quad are not doing a favor on India by 'allowing' to be in the Quad. India is the only nation in the Quad which has fought battles with China in recent years. India is the only nation among Quad partners that shares a land border with China, 3500 km of land border, no less. And the fact that the ""Indo"" in the Indo-Pacific is the Indian Ocean Region, where India has a massive coastline and is the dominant maritime power.The rise of the political force that is the Bharatiya Janata Party under Modi’s leadership has been providing employment opportunities to a lot of columnists and Left-liberal propagandists around the world for nearly a decade now. An entire cabal of Left-liberal ‘analysts’, self-proclaimed ‘intellectuals’ and columnists keep themselves gainfully employed by writing doom and gloom pieces against India, its so-called downfall to an imaginary abyss of misery because that is what their Leftist ecosystem, and Western paymasters love to read. The whole system works like the fanbase of a fantasy universe. The doom and gloom never come. Modi keeps winning election after election, India prospers faster and faster and keeps rising as a major global power, contrary to everything that the Leftists have been predicting (wrongly) for nearly a decade. But there is just no course correction. The higher-ups pay for fantasy pieces hating on Modi, so the columnists of the bottom keep producing the lies, again and again. The ecosystem survives on Modi hate and India hate. The latest in this series is another word salad of lies and falsehoods published in Bloomberg, written by Ruth Pollard. The article, titled “India’s identity is more hardline Hindu than ever“, doesn’t even know how to deal with the reality that Modi is set to win another term in office. In desperation, the author has jotted down some points and tried very hard to paint a picture of doom and gloom with so many lies and blatant misinformation that the result is a pathetic rant, not even worthy of being called an opinion. Pollard begins by noting down the BJP’s 3 key objectives. And acknowledges that 2 of them have already been achieved. She adds that BJP came to power with 3 major promises:Here is how Pollard has lied through her teeth in this article. What is surprising is that publications like Bloomberg do not even engage a minimal editorial scrutiny or basic fact checks before publishing utter nonsense. Pollard claims that Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only ‘Muslim majority state’ was “forcibly brought under the control of the federal government in 2019”. Pollard has tried to create the idea that Jammu and Kashmir was somehow NOT a part of India and under India’s territorial and administrative sovereignty, just because it was ‘Muslim majority’. The abrogation of Article 370 that allowed Jammu and Kashmir to TEMPORARILY have its own laws and penal code was legal, constitutional, and was done in the democratically elected Parliament, by the power vested on the government by the people of India. It was supported by a majority vote of the Members of Parliament, which includes representatives from the region and has been upheld by all Indian laws.Whatever made Ruth Pollard believe that India cannot give the residents of Jammu and Kashmir the same rights that are enjoyed by all other Indians, is certainly derived from similar-level trash op-eds by her fellow Left propagandists and not rooted in an actual understanding of Indian laws and constitutional process. The Bloomberg columnist peddles utter lies on the Uniform Civil Code next. She insinuates, out of nothing, just her imagination, that the Uniform Civil Code, which by its very definition means a single, uniform code for all Indian citizens, will be unfair to Muslims. She then peddles total lies to justify that conjecture, that Modi will somehow sneak in loopholes that would allow Hindus to carry on their “worst practices”, like the dowry system and allowing only sons to inherit property while taking away the right of polygamy from Muslims. Anyone with an iota of understanding of Indian laws will know that Hindus of the country are the only community who do not get any special rights to carry on with their existing social ills. All Hindu women are entitled to inherit property, by Indian law. The practice of dowry, which is not limited to Hindus alone, is a punishable crime under Article 498A which has been called ‘too strict’ and to some extent even ‘unfair’ because of the amount of power it gives to women. However, Hindus are prohibited from practicing polygamy, unlike Muslims, and unlike Muslims, Hindu families cannot deprive their daughters of property rights.The columnist claims that the Ram Mandir is being built by the Modi government after ‘Hindu extremists’ tore down a 16th-century mosque, and the riots that followed, caused ‘mostly Muslims’ to die. The blatant lie has been told so smoothly that for clueless readers, who are obviously the target audience of the Bloomberg article, it would appear that the cruel Hindus of India demolished a holy Islamic site and forcibly are building a temple over it. She does not bother to mention that the site was ‘Ram Janmabhoomi’, the birthplace of Lord Ram, where a temple existed for centuries before Islamic rulers demolished it. It does not mention that the Hindus, despite their population majority and political power, waited patiently and fought a legal battle for several decades to claim ownership of the site. It does not even mention the thousands of Hindus who were gunned down by state police of ‘secular governments’ for trying to protest against the desecration of their sacred land. It also does not mention that the Muslims were given an alternate site to build their mosque, which they accepted. The next cycle of frustration of the author is displayed through a geopolitical point of view. She is angry at the USA, Japan, and Australia for not bullying India. She is also irritated at the fact that India, despite having the ‘Hindu’ Modi in power, is considered an important Quad ally by these nations for their desire to counter China. Like many Left liberal columnists, Pollard forgets that the partners of the Indo-Pacific Quad are not doing a favor on India by ‘allowing’ to be in the Quad. India is the only nation in the Quad which has fought battles with China in recent years. India is the only nation among Quad partners that shares a land border with China, 3500 km of land border, no less. And the fact that the “Indo” in the Indo-Pacific is the Indian Ocean Region, where India has a massive coastline and is the dominant maritime power, not to mention one of the strongest naval forces in the world. Someone should ask these columnists how exactly they plan to exclude India from the Indian Ocean Region. That ocean is called the “Indian” ocean for a reason after all. The article concludes with some hard swallowed cope. It admits reluctantly that India is the fastest-growing economic power and investors are increasingly looking to put money in India rather than China. It acknowledges that Modi is set to win another term in office, and the sadness in tone is palpable when the author writes “Modi is a force to be reckoned with”, to finish her article.

"4 December, 2023 ",Ravish Kumar’s bizarre rant: Ex-NDTV journalist says Shivraj Chouhan defeated Narendra Modi in the MP assembly election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ravish-kumar-shivraj-chouhan-narendra-modi-mp-election/,"It is a well-known fact that ground reporting is the cornerstone of credible journalism. However, Ravish Kumar's analysis lacked ground reporting as he admitted not going to Madhya Pradesh.The landscape of Indian politics is ever-evolving. The narrative surrounding the elections is extensively complex for the citizens to decipher. Thus, sharp and knowledgeable electoral analysts are essential for the world of media. However, sometimes, the hate and apathy of the analysts make it challenging to give a fair reasoning for the outcome of the elections. One such analysis of Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections has been done by “infamous” journalist-turned-YouTuber Ravish Kumar. While he tried to provide a “unique perspective” of the MP election results, a critical examination of his 20-minute-long rant revealed certain aspects that merit questioning.Firstly, Ravish Kumar selectively emphasised particular aspects of the elections, such as posters and social media posts. He constructed a narrative of Shivraj Singh Chouhan being sidelined within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), based on selected social media posts and posters.However, they are only a tiny fragment of a larger, sophisticated political mosaic. It is a well-known fact that ground reporting is the cornerstone of credible journalism. However, Ravish Kumar’s analysis lacked ground reporting as he admitted not going to Madhya Pradesh to sniff out the ground narrative and realities that often shape the election outcomes.Ravish Kumar assumed that the media reports were based on the “inside knowledge” of the party that some journalists have. It became another point of contention in his analysis. He implied an intentional sidelining of Chouhan for sympathy, a claim based on pure speculation. This kind of assumption risks oversimplifying the multifaceted nature of the political decisions that the party takes within the organisation. Ravish Kumar also ignored the dynamic interplay of the various factors, including the work done by the state government and how the central government played a role in implementing different schemes.His analysis also underestimated the genuine influence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the psyche of the voters, especially in a state like Madhya Pradesh, where BJP has ruled for over 19 years. In a way, Kumar criticised the BJP for relying heavily on Modi’s face in the election campaigning. However, he forgot that every national political party, whether BJP, Congress, or even AAP, brings their top leaders into the play during campaigning.PM Modi’s appeal transcends regional boundaries. It has been pivotal in multiple electoral victories, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. His presence in the political landscape during campaigning cannot be ignored and dismissed. Furthermore, Lok Sabha elections 2024 are approaching fast, and the five-state assembly elections are seen as precursor for the General Elections. It was essential for the BJP to understand how ‘Modi Magic’ is playing its role in the hearts of the voters. The results of the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh elections made it clearer how the BJP should play its cards for the General Elections.Ravish Kumar completely ignored the strategic decisions made by the political parties. He acknowledged that knowing everything inside the party office is impossible but continued to form a perspective around op-eds and social media posts. How can a seasoned “journalist” like Ravish Kumar forget that the media is biased? They publish op-eds and reports based on their political leaning. How can someone like Ravish Kumar forget that the media ran similar reports of differences between UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi just before the UP Assembly Elections?BJP’s decision not to project a local face for the Chief Minister’s position was a calculated move. It reflects a deeper understanding of the political terrain and the party’s electoral strategy. Elections are complex battles. Every action has to be precise, as a wrong placement of a pawn can finish the game in seconds. Ravish’s analysis lacked the understanding of the nature of the game-play that the BJP had for the MP election.Ravish asserted that Shivraj Singh Chouhan‘s local initiatives played a vital role in the election’s outcome. However, he failed to recognise that the voters of the states under the BJP are not limited to state issues. They know the importance of having the same party at the center and in the state assembly. Various factions, including national-level governance and leadership credibility, often influence the voters’ decisions.In a diverse and dynamic country like India, forming a narrative based on social media posts and a few op-eds is impossible. The ground-level approach is a must to understand the background so that one can create the right direction in reaching a conclusion about the results. Ravish’s analysis lacked that critical aspect and showed how distanced he was from reality. Most of the voters are not on social media.4,34,23,475 (Four Crores, thirty-Four Lakhs, Twenty-Three Thousand, Four Hundred and Seventy-Five) votes were cast in the MP elections. Only a fraction of them are influenced by the social media posts on X and Facebook, which were the basis of Ravish’s analysis that Chouhan was “sidelined”. The ground reality in most of the cases is different.Ravish Kumar serves the Hindi-speaking viewers. While his followers navigate the shadows of political narratives based on his videos, it is imperative to understand the importance of a holistic and nuanced understanding of the complex narrative dance of the Indian elections. Ravish Kumar failed in it, and he failed his viewers in that motion.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan.

Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"18 November, 2023 ",Madhya Pradesh: Political fight between two groups in Jabalpur portrayed online as an attack on Sikhs,https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/madhya-pradesh-jabalpur-sikh-man-beaten-poltiical-fight-given-communal-angle-fact-check/,"The scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during the Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. On Friday (17th November), a video of a confrontation between two groups was falsely presented as a hate crime against the Sikh community by a Hindu mob.The incident reportedly took place in Jabalpur city of Madhya Pradesh. A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur. While raising religious slogans, people badly beat up a person from the Sikh community,” tweeted one ‘mdirfan997’.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) also amplified the incident and asked the Madhya Pradesh Police to take action.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami has taken notice of a viral video from Jabalpur, in which, a Sikh is seen being assaulted by some men.

"10 December, 2023 ","‘Rebel’ Washington Post reporter plans hitjob on Indian OSINT handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, gets exposed instead: What happened",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-reporter-pranshu-verma-planning-hitjob-osint-handle-disinfo-lab/,"As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India inch closer, Western media cartels and other vested interests are increasingly targeting those exposing anti-India narratives on social media.On Friday (8th December, US local time), American political commentator Jack Posobiec took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform that a reporter from the leftist media outlet The Washington Post was soliciting information about Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’The ‘reporter’ was identified as Pranshu Verma, a tech ‘journalist’ who started working with The Washington Post in February 2022. He had reached out to Jack Posobiec in the hopes of deterring the American political commentator from sharing informative posts of ‘Disinfo Lab.’ “We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab,” Pranshu Verma revealed his plans to carry out a hit job on the Indian OSINT handle. “Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he told Jack Posobiec.Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0Without furnishing any evidence, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ claimed, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?”Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.Although Pranshu Verma writes mundane articles on technology, he was roped in by The Washington Post to disseminate anti-India propaganda.In January this year, he romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in KashiIn his article in January 2023, Pranshu Verma relied on a database provided by ‘DOTO’ to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India. ‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. Coincidentally, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ is now hounding the same Indian OSINT handle that uncovered the dubious nature of his news report.Verma’s story is a desperate attempt to paint ‘rising hatred in India’ and one of the ‘evidences’ he has quoted is the DOTO database. DOTO was fabricating numbers of ‘atrocities’ on minorities in India.AFTER our expose, DOTO first REVISED its database and later DELETED!(4/n) pic.twitter.com/sVpCEs6QvTAround the same time he was soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab’ from Jack Posobiec, ‘rebel’ Pranshu Verma staged a one-day strike against his employer The Washington Post over lack of ‘fair wages.’“Today I walked off the job with more than 700 of my Washington Post colleagues because the company is breaking the law and bargaining in bad faith,” he had tweeted on Thursday (7th December).Thrilled to see so many colleagues on the picket line today. pic.twitter.com/nicoMxMimz“Respect our @PostGuild picket line: Avoid Washington Post journalism on Dec. 7. Thrilled to see so many colleagues on the picket line today,” he said in another tweet.As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India inch closer, Western media cartels and other vested interests are increasingly targeting those exposing anti-India narratives on social media.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.TMC’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha after the Ethics Committee tabled its report on her corruption and bribery. She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this?

All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you.

Shameful.”Without due process and being given a chance to defend herself #MahuaMoitra is expelled. ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no? Think.”So a 104 page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at 12 noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled.

Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"5 December, 2023 ","Rajdeep Sardesai tortures data to death, and compares apples with oranges, to try and give hope to Congress after party’s drubbing in assembly elections",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rajdeep-sardesai-data-congress-assembly-elections-positive/,"If Sardesai's logic is to be considered, Congress should have won at least 14 seats in Rajasthan in 2019, 20+ seats in MP, and 8 seats in Chhattisgarh, but in reality the numbers were 0,1, and 2 respectively. On 3rd December, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Assembly Elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh by a wide margin. Congress, which won all 3 states when elections were held in 2018, lost in all 3 states.However, some individuals cook up theories to show the results that these assembly elections will favour Congress in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. One such individual is India Today’s anchor Rajdeep Sardesai, who came up with a bizarre interpretation of the results to spin the narrative in Congress’s favour.On 5th December, Sardesai published an “analytic” post on the numbers from the Assembly Elections and compared it to the General Election results from 2019 so that Congress came out in a better position.Interesting Data point: In 2019 BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, Cong 0; based on Vidhan Sabha 2023 results , BJP would win 14 Lok Sabha seats , Cong 11 in 2024. Madhya Pradesh: BJP…According to him, in 2019, the BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, and Congress failed to win a single seat. Based on the 2023 Assembly Election results, the BJP will win 14 seats, and Congress will win 11 in 2024.Similarly, he claimed that BJP won 28 seats in Lok Sabha in Madhya Pradesh 2019 and Congress won only one. Based on the 2023 Vidhan Sabha results, the BJP would win 24, and the Congress would win 5 in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections.In Chhattisgarh, he asserted that BJP won 9 seats and Congress won 2 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP would win eight, and Congress would win three seats in Lok Sabha 2024.In Telangana, the BJP had won 4, and the Congress won 3 in 2019, which would tune into nine seats for Congress and 0 for the BJP.Sardesai attempted to spin the Congress loss in the assembly elections as a positive outcome for the party in the upcoming General Elections. Selectively using the 2023 Assembly Election results compared to the 2019 General Election results would not work, as Sardesai claimed. Let’s talk numbers. According to the data provided by the Election Commission of India (ECI), in the 2013 Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections, the BJP won 143 seats, and the Congress won 71 seats. In the 2018 MP Assembly Elections, BJP won 109 seats, and Congress won 114 seats. In the 2023 Assembly Elections in MP, BJP won 163 seats, and Congress won 66 seats. Now, coming to Lok Sabha Elections in 2014, BJP won 27 seats, and Congress won 2 seats. In the 2019 General Elections, BJP won 28 seats, and Congress won 1 seat.In the 2013 Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections, BJP won 50 seats, and Congress won 38 seats. In the 2018 Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections, BJP won 15 seats, and Congress won 68. In the 2023 Assembly Elections in Chhattisgarh, BJP won 54 seats, and Congress won 35. Now, coming to Lok Sabha Elections in 2014, BJP won 10 seats, and Congress won 1 seat. In 2019, BJP won 9 seats and Congress won 2 seats.In the 2013 Rajasthan Assembly Elections, BJP won 163 seats, and Congress won 21 seats. In the 2018 Assembly Elections in Rajasthan, BJP won 73 seats, and Congress won 100 seats. In 2023, the BJP won 115 seats, and Congress won 69 seats. In the Lok Sabha Elections 2014, BJP won 25 seats, and Congress won zero seats. In 2019, the BJP won 25 seats, and the Congress won zero seats.If Sardesai’s logic is to be considered, Congress should have won at least 14 seats in Rajasthan in 2019, 20+ seats in MP, and 8 seats in Chhattisgarh, but in reality the numbers were 0,1, and 2 respectively. But in reality, Congress nosedived in the Lok Sabha 2019 elections. Based on the numbers, it is clear that the voting dynamics are entirely different regarding Lok Sabha and Assembly Elections. Voters chose the national issues during the Lok Sabha elections and favoured BJP in all three states in the last two Lok Sabha elections, irrespective of the voting patterns in the assembly elections.Sardesai cherry-picked the data and claimed there could be a way to defeat PM Modi’s influence on the Lok Sabha Elections. He misinterpreted and misrepresented the prevailing political sentiment. His analysis hinged on the assumption that the 2023 Assembly would translate into the Lok Sabha outcomes in 2024, ignoring the unique dynamics of state and national elections.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22.

I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"2 December, 2023 ",UP: Pet cat bites Imtiazuddin and his son Azim in Kanpur; both die of rabies within a week,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/up-pet-cat-bites-man-and-his-son-kanpur-dehat-both-die-of-rabies-within-a-week/,"In a tragic incident that has instilled fear in the Kanpur Dehat region, a father and son lost their lives to a cat bite in Kanpur Dehat. Imtiazuddin, a resident, had warmly raised a cat in his home, with the entire family showering it with affection. Unfortunately, the family’s world turned upside down when the pet cat fell victim to a stray dog bite, unknowingly contracting rabies. Ignorant of the rabies symptoms, Imtiazuddin and his son Azim were bitten by the ailing cat. Within a week, the devastating consequences of rabies claimed both of their lives.The family had no clue that their cat, which they played with and fed, would lead to a tragic outcome. While having fun, the cat occasionally scratched and bit its owners. Imtiazuddin’s son Azim worked in Noida. He came to the home on a short leave. during this time, this pet cat bit him.Azim’s health worsened, and a medical examination revealed rabies symptoms. Despite treatment, 24-year-old Azim passed away, leaving the family in grief. Just a week after Azim’s tragic death, his father Imtiazuddin began showing signs of rabies. The local community and family members were gripped with panic witnessing Imtiazuddin’s distressing condition. Upon seeking medical attention, it was confirmed that he, too, was suffering from rabies. Despite undergoing treatment, Imtiazuddin passed away merely seven days after the loss of his son.The neighbourhood is now in a state of panic as fear of stray dogs and cats grips the community. Families that once kept pets are hastily arranging to relocate their animals. This is particularly seen in those households with dogs or cats. The two deaths in a family within a week due to rabies have left the area in shock.Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The RABV virus infection is the root of the ailment. The virus infects the central nervous system of mammals which ultimately results in brain disease and death. It causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in humans and other mammals.Rabies was historically referred to as hydrophobia (fear of water) due to the symptom of panic when presented with liquids to drink. It is spread from the saliva of infected animals. The majority of rabies in the United States are linked to skunks, raccoons, bats and foxes. However, dogs continue to carry the rabies virus in many other nations, including India, and dog bites are the leading cause of rabies-related deaths in humans worldwide.The animals most likely to spread the rabies virus to people include pets and farm animals like cats, cows, dogs, ferrets, goats, horses and wild animals like bats, beavers, coyotes, foxes, monkeys, raccoons, skunks and woodchucks.The epidemic of rabies in IndiaThe number of human deaths globally due to dog-mediated rabies is estimated to be 59,000 annually. India is responsible for 36% of rabies-related deaths worldwide, according to the statistics of the World Health Organisation. The National Rabies Control Programme recorded 6644 medically suspected cases and fatalities of rabies between 2012 and 2022. Recent cases of rabies death which got wider media attention were from Meerut, Chennai, and Ghaziabad.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Where is the money – What happens to the cash recovered by Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax department during raids,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/what-happens-to-cash-recovered-during-ed-raids-cbi-income-tax/,"First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Income Tax (IT) Department conduct multiple raids every year, resulting in the recovery of unaccounted cash worth crores. With swanky photographs of seized money arranged to form letters like “E” and “D” to denote ED during raids, the question arises: What happens to the cash recovered by the agencies during raids?When the ED, CBI, or IT Department seizes unaccounted money, they cannot just keep it on their office premises. First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The actual process of seizing the cash starts from here. The State Bank of India is called in to count the seized cash. Simultaneously, a list of seized cash is prepared with the details of the recovered amount in specific denominations such as Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100, Rs 50 and so on. Based on the amount, the bank deploys multiple cash counting machines to ensure smooth and quick completion of the counting process.Once the counting is complete, the cash is sealed in the boxes in the presence of independent witnesses. The cash is then taken to the SBI branch, where it is deposited under the agency’s Personal Deposit (PD) account. Later, the cash is moved to the central government’s treasury.Notably, cash can be used only once the case is over in the court of law. Neither the ED, nor the bank, nor the government has the right to use the money for any purposes while the case is sub-judice. The agency issues a provisional attachment order, and an adjudicating authority must confirm the attachment within six months. This order ensures that the accused cannot benefit from the seized cash. Notably, the agency can only hold onto the cash for 180 days. During that time, the agency has to prove the validity of the seizure. In case the agency fails to do so, the money gets returned to the accused automatically.How the money will be used depends on the outcome of the case. If the accused acquits, the cash gets returned; otherwise, if convicted, the money becomes government property.Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax Department can raid, investigate and seize property in cases of money laundering, scams, tax fraud, or irregularities.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Who is Dhiraj Prasad Sahu – The Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand at the centre of the historic Income Tax raid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-prasad-sahu-rajya-sabha-mp-jharkhand-it-raid/,"Dhiraj Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the Indian National Congress, the grand old party, is once again surrounded by controversies. The party has yet to recover from the crushing defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. It is now facing intense scrutiny as the Income Tax (IT) Department has recovered hundreds of crores of unaccounted cash from properties linked to its Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.By 9th December, the IT Department recovered nearly Rs 300 crores from the premises linked to Sahu, and further recovery is still underway. Congress Party officially distanced itself from the controversy and claimed it had nothing to do with the cash recovered by the IT Department. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party’s General Secretary in Communications, Jairam Ramesh, claimed that the Indian National Congress has nothing to do with the businesses run by its Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand. The senior Congress functionary added that only the accused in the case, Sahu, could explain the source for vast piles of cash reportedly seized from his properties and demanded an explanation from Sahu.The money recovered by the IT department is said to be linked to Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Private Limited and its related organisations, where Sahu is a partner. Over nineteen bags containing cash were taken from the home of a certain Bunty Sahu, who was assigned to oversee the management of liquor facilities in the Odisha regions. Three dozen machines were deployed to count the cash. Reports suggest some of the machines broke down during counting, resulting in a delay in completing the process. Reportedly, Bhagat Beherea, the Regional Manager of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, said that the bank had received 176 bags containing money in total. Fifty workers and twenty-five counting machines have been deployed to count the currency notes.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner in Baldev Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd, a group company of Budha Distilleries. He has been a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand since 2009. Sahu’s family has been linked to Congress for a long time.Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Slowly and steadily, he climbed the party ladder and served as office-bearer in the Lohardaga district and later in the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee.In 2009, he was elected Rajya Sabha member for the first time in a bypoll. He was re-elected for the second term in 2010. In May 2018, he became the third time Rajya Sabha member of Congress from Jharkhand.According to his profile on the Rajya Sabha website, his family has been associated with Congress since independence. He was part of “Jail Bharo Aandolan” in 1978. He has asked 630 questions in Rajya Sabha since 2010, with the latest being related to the Kavach Safety System, procurement of paddy, losses due to damage to national highways, accidents in coal mines, privatisation of airports and more.In November 2022, Sahu participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, yet another attempt of the Congress Party to “launch” Gandhi into politics and project him as Prime Minister candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. In a post on X, Dhiraj Sahu shared some photographs from the Yatra.भारत जोड़ो यात्रा के दौरान कुछ पल।#BharatJodoYatra@bharatjodo @INCIndia @INCJharkhand pic.twitter.com/g3lYQSRoBkLater, in February 2023, Sahu published a video from the Yatra and wrote, “Historic Bharat Jodo Yatra ended up winning the hearts of Indians.

"10 December, 2023 ","Mahua Moitra was Vice President at JP Morgan, but that post doesn’t mean what one may imagine. Here is the truth about fancy designations...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohua-moitra-was-vice-president-at-jp-morgan-that-does-not-mean-she-was-in-very-senior-position/,"A vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. On 8th December (Friday), the Lok Sabha voted in favour of expelling the Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on the recommendation of the Ethics Committee against the TMC leader in connection with the cash-for-query scam case. Since her ouster, several netizens have flaunted her past credentials as the Vice President at the Investment Banking giant JP Morgan and Chase. Notably, it is touted among the big five in the Investment banking sector. Supporting the accused TMC leader, some social media users claimed that she is innocent of the cash-for-query scam case and alleged that it is an attempt to silence her. They argued that Moitra left her lucrative and ‘distinguished’ position at one of the biggest investment banks (I-bank) to enter politics and serve the people of her constituency.इस खूबसूरत तस्वीर को गौर से देखिये….इसे देखकर पता लगता है क्या कि इस महिला ने करोड़ो रु की बैंक की नौकरी एक झटके में समाज सेवा के लिए छोड़ दी थी…इस तस्वीर से यह भी नही लगता कि इस महिला की एक स्पीच से पूरी बीजेपी के फासीवाद को नंगा कर दिया था ये तस्वीर यह भी नही बताती यह… pic.twitter.com/dojLHNKUusAdditionally, they asserted that her lavish lifestyle is a result of her previous role as the VP at JP Morgan, a high-paying and consequential post. Furthermore, they claimed that her ‘senior’ position in the top Investment Bank underscores her leadership qualities, which have rattled her naysayers insinuating that she has a brain of her own and didn’t need to take cues from others to shape her decisions countering the allegations that she accepted bribery to ask pliable questions. However, several netizens have pointed out that the senior-most designation in the I-banks is not a rarity linked with high calibre and exemplary growth. Instead, it is a general trend in Investment Banks to dole out fancy designations to scores of employees, sometimes even in the hundreds to thousands. This is done for various reasons, including massaging the egos of their employees, non-cash retention tools to assuage lower paychecks, or creating an impression on clients/customers, among other considerations.Some fools are under the impression that Mahua Moitra once being ""vice president"" at some bank is a huge dealAt big investment banks, almost everyone is a ""vice president""Goldman-Sachs for example reportedly has almost 12,000 ""vice-presidents."" pic.twitter.com/maCl78aqCB""Vice President"" in an investment bank is not what you think it is https://t.co/8jHDYA0QFG pic.twitter.com/Qmik1Yrw4LIt is generally assumed that an official with senior-most designations like Vice-President, Director, or Managing Director would be among the highest-ranking decision-makers in any company or country, possibly holding the 2nd or 3rd authority in the entity. However, things are different in I-Banks, and according to reports, as high as 30-40% or even higher of officials enjoy these fancy titles of VP, Director, or MD without their designations granting them as much power, privilege, or reflection of experience as their contemporary designation holders in non-I-Banks get.In March 2012, Goldman Sachs, in a court case, noted that the plaintiff Greg Smith, an estranged VP of the firm, was one of 12,000 VPs in their organisation. Back then, US media also estimated that 40% of Goldman staff were VPs as it was estimated to have 2,400 managing directors!While it was a decade-old case, things have not changed much, and recent estimates also highlight that there are between 10,000 and 12,000 Vice Presidents employed at Goldman Sachs, FourWeekMBA reported in October this year.Reuters in November this year reported that Goldman Sachs would promote 608 executives to managing directors next year. These would be fewer than the 643 senior bankers it elevated two years ago, according to a company memo. Notably, the Wall Street firm announces managing director promotions every two years. The number of promotions this year is the lowest since Goldman promoted 465 in 2019, before the pandemic, the report added.Similarly, on 4the July 2022, the global accounting and consulting firm EY became the latest firm to promote thousands of its employees to “partner” without offering them a share of profits, the Financial Times reported. However, outside the non-I-banking terminology, a ‘partner’ is often assumed a co-founder or large shareholder which is not the case in I-banks.   However, this phenomenon isn’t confined to I-banks alone. According to a report from the Small Investor Protection Association, there are approximately 121,000 registered financial professionals in Canada. The majority of them, classified as dealing representatives, are essentially salespeople licensed to sell financial investments. Only about 4,000 among these registered financial professionals bear a fiduciary duty, a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. Meanwhile, the exact figures and percentages of individuals bearing these inflated corporate titles may vary, the prevalence of fancy designations, as exemplified by Goldman Sachs, is a common practice in the sphere of investment banking. This broad trend is observed in I-banks worldwide, including those in India. This means that I-banks are plentiful of Vice-presidents, directors, and managing directors.A consultant from a financial services company, Jerome Tillier, conducted a test and discovered a significant number of hits when searching for the keyword ‘bank vice-president’ in LinkedIn’s search box. He pointed out that this number is larger than the population of Malta. Similarly, when searching for the keyword ‘Vice President JP Morgan Chase’ in India, the results yield thousands of hits, featuring dozens of Vice Presidents, Managing Directors, and other senior positions available regularly.Furthermore, in a wrongful termination lawsuit between Bank of America and an Indian-American, Padmanabhan Ramanathan, at the California Court of Appeals in 2007, the bank’s legal representation made an unusual assertion. As detailed by the California Business Litigation Blog, the counsel contended that the bank has the authority to label any employee, “including janitors, maintenance workers, everyone,” as “vice-presidents” if it so chooses. The assertion that a bank can make even a janitor as VP aptly explains why an Investment bank VP or MD doesn’t immediately translate to authority, experience, and command in that domain or career growth viz-a-viz equivalent title holder employed in non-I-banks. It is important to note that the abundance of such posts has diminished the perceived authority associated with these positions. Evidently, a vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. This begs the question: What accounts for the abundance of these fancy titles in certain fields like Investment banking?Foremost, Indian and India-based banks adopted a well-established practice observed in American banks, particularly investment banks (I-banks). Evidently, post-liberalisation, American banks introduced their HR norms to India, and the influence of peer pressure compelled Indian private banks and I-banks to conform to these practices.A major reason for these inflated Corporate titles is to stoke egos. A bank executive said, “Fancy designations address a human need for validation by employers.”The head of one of the largest MNC I-banks in India noted, “The MD designation gives social status…being an MD symbolises seniority outside.”Another reason for so many VPs, MDs, and Directors is to make an impression on customers.K Sudarshan is a managing partner, Asia at EMA Partners International which is a global executive search firm.Explaining the rationale and power wielded by such fancy titles, Sudarshan said, “Designations like MD, VP are not jobs, but grades that reflect seniority. VPs are just fancy titles on visiting cards for market-facing executives… VPs are ubiquitous and the title does not mean anything and has nothing to do with the job one is doing…even the person managing in-house tech support can be called MD, technology.”VP & Head – HR, India Factoring and Finance Solutions, Gauri Das explains that companies try to go innovative with designation, wherever required, and use it as a “retention tool”.According to Das, another reason for fancy designation is to compensate for low payouts by giving a very high social status through designations. This is because afancy and inflated title does not cost money and is not necessarily linked with the paycheck, making it an easy tool for employee happiness.As per experts, one of the reasons can also be to create a buzz on social media. Das added, “Fancy designations help you get many eyeballs.” Job titles like Customer Service Evangelist, Marketing Dynamo, Head of First Impressions (Receptionist), Opportunity Creator (Business Development), and Master of Disaster (the one who helps federal agencies with information to manage calamities) among others are an example of it.In a sector where customer perception is crucial, a headhunter said, “A customer meeting a vice-president is going to be a bit impressed…and a company looking for an acquisition likes the idea of liaising with an MD.”He added, “These designations are visiting card tools for banks to present a grand face to people and companies.”Meanwhile, after her education, Mahua Moitra worked as an investment banker for Investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase in New York and London. In 2009, she quit her position as one of the vice presidents of JPMorgan Chase in London to join politics, where there were thousands of VPs in the bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In the year 2015, the then Minister of State for the Ministry of Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju suspended the FCRA registration of the Tuticorin Diocesan, Association and 2 other NGOs based on the adverse reports received from the intelligence agencies. The government then froze the bank accounts of the said NGOs and stated that the organizations were using foreign funds for anti-national activities. In a most significant move, the Hon'ble MP of Narasapuram Lok Sabha Constituency Sri Raghu Ramakrishna Raju wrote to Sri Amit Shah and Home Secretary for action against large scale violation of FCRA rules & misuse of foreign funds by Tuticorin Diocesan Association & its ally NGO pic.twitter.com/wy8gJbXFAVHowever, Raghu Ramakrishna Raju revealed in the complaint to the Home Ministry on 7th December that the NGOs continue to receive foreign funds in their respective FCRA-designated bank accounts which were said to have been frozen by the government. As per the complaint the Tuticorin Diocesan Association is said to have received Rs. 4,45,07,214 in its Bank of Baroda account designated to receive foreign funds. The said funds were received by the NGO from the financial year 2015-16 to 2017-18 in the name of the Welfare of Children, maintenance and construction of Orphanages. Some transactions were also made in the name of ‘Mass Intention’ which has no specific description. “A large amount of foreign funds received by the Tuticorin Diocesan Association to its ‘Frozen’ bank accounts were transferred to the individual accounts of its office bearers. The NGO also transferred the illegal money to another account with Syndicate Bank at the Tuticorin Branch. In addition, Rs. 1,25,00,000 out of the foreign funds were transferred to a few construction companies from the frozen bank account of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association post cancellation of its FCRA license. The reasons for such a transfer of amount are to be investigated,” the complaint read. Notably, it has also come to the fore that a large portion of foreign funds, around Rs 1.6 crores, received by the Tuticorin Diocesan Association after the suspension if its FCRA license has come from Apostolic Nunciature India, a diplomatic entity of the Vatican government having its office in New Delhi. The amount transferred by Apostolic Nunciature India from 2016 to 2018 was shown as a foreign contribution by the NGO in question. As per the letter copy, the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society which claims to be a sub-entity or social wing of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association (FCRA: 076030038) also received Rs 34,81,691 as foreign funds in its account after it’s FCRA license had been suspended. “The intention of the diplomatic organization to fund the NGO which has lost its FCRA license and its bank accounts were frozen by the Government of India by declaring its activities as ‘Anti-National’ should be investigated,” the MP noted in the complaint. The bank accounts of the NGO which were frozen by the government are operational even after the government action and most of the foreign funds are being obtained in the name of Child welfare activities. “This raises concerns. We request you take the necessary action by referring the matter to the Enforcement Directorate to immediately register a case in this matter and to conduct a detailed investigation of the activities of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association and Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society,” the complaint read. It is important to note that these NGOs had a major role to play in organizing and leading the protest against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, which was developed in collaboration with Russia in the year 2011-12. The NGOs were associated with Bishop Yvon Ambroise, the Tuticorin church leader, who had been active in mobilizing popular support for the protests at Kudankulam back then. In the year 2011, the Church-sponsored rabble-rousers and hooligans delayed the critical Kudankulam power plant, hitting the country at a time when energy requirements were rapidly increasing. The majority of those who took part in the Nagercoil protest marches were from various Catholic churches. Several churches and NGOs including the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS) drew fear among the people against the nuclear facility and advised people to participate in the protests against the Kudankulam project. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power situated in the state of Tamil Nadu was conceptualized as the largest Nuclear Power plant in India with a total capacity of 6000 MW. The construction of the plant began way back in 2002 but it was marred by constant protests.This protest reached a boiling point in 2011 when the villagers reportedly feared that a Fukushima-type disaster might befall the Nuclear plant. As reported earlier, one of the prominent leaders of the anti-Kudankulam movement was the then SP Udayakumar, who led the People’s Movement against Nuclear Energy.Incidentally, this whole protest had come under suspicion way back in 2012 when there were reports about the protest being allegedly backed by the Church and various foreign parties emerged. In 2014 there were further allegations after an alleged IB report had claimed that Udayakumar had been working on the behest of various American and German entities to subvert the development of India.The then-Union Minister V Narayanasamy asserted that Bishop Yavon Ambroise of Tuticorin had received Rs 54 crore and was the driving force behind the demonstrations. Many Christian organizations, such as People’s Education for Action and Liberation and Good Vision, were identified as troublemakers by the Home Ministry. The list also included the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS). The Union Home Secretary said in 2012 that four non-governmental organizations’ bank accounts including the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS) had been seized after it was determined that they had been utilizing money from foreign sources to fund anti-nuclear protests. The CBI filed two cases, while the Tamil Nadu police Crime Branch filed two.Moreover, in 2017, Republic TV came up with a sting operation on Udyakumar and various members of the Tamil Nadu Church, which seemed to further corroborate the “foreign-funded protest theory”.The reporters then followed the Church-backed protest angle and zeroed in on a Church in Idinthakarai which according to them was a hub of anti-nuclear protests. They reportedly stung a Parish priest named Jayakumar who managed the money used in the protest. He had selected 70 people who were set up as a front while he and the Diocese controlled things from behind the curtains. Apparently, he took care of all the protests in Idinthakarai and there were 13 other Fathers who similarly managed 13 other villages.The report also claimed that this whole church involvement was orchestrated by a Bishop who had suggested that Jayakumar operates from the background. The Bishop was incidentally the person who was withstanding all the external ‘pressure’ like the cancellation of their FCRA license.The reporters also interviewed a villager who claimed that all the NGOs were run by Bishops who paid money to Christian people if they took part in the protests. Through these sting operations, it appeared that the main motivation for the whole protest was not an aversion to Nuclear Power but a desire to earn money.The Legal Rights Protection Forum while talking to OpIndia confirmed that “the bank accounts of these NGOs were frozen by the government in the year 2015. Their FCRA license had also been canceled. However, they continue to receive foreign funding under the name of child care or ‘mass intention’ which nobody knows what it means. These NGOs undertake anti-national activities and the same was noted by the government. Strict action against such NGOs is a must,” LRPF said.

The announcement was made at the party meeting held in Lucknow on Sunday. The meeting was presided over by Mayawati, and she was accompanied by her nephew Akash Anand. It was called to plan the party’s preparations for the upcoming Lok Sabha 2024 polls. Speaking with ANI about the party meeting, BSP leader Udayveer Singh said, “BSP chief Mayawati has announced Akash Anand as her successor.”#WATCH | Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh | Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Udayveer Singh says, ""BSP chief Mayawati has announced Akash Anand (Mayawati's nephew) as her successor…"" pic.twitter.com/nT1jmAMI29Reacting to the development, BSP UP president Vishwnath Pal said, “The whole ‘Bahujan Samaj’ is happy.”VIDEO | ""The whole 'Bahujan Samaj' is happy,"" says BSP UP president @PalVishwnathbsp in response to a media query on Mayawati declaring her nephew Akash Anand as her successor. pic.twitter.com/8lsYijAcEkNotably, Akash Anand is the son of Mayawati’s younger brother, Anand Kumar. Currently, Akash holds the official position of BSP’s national coordinator. As per his official X account, he describes himself as “A young supporter of Baba Saheb’s vision”.For several years now, he was perceived as the successor of BSP Supremo. It was considered that he would succeed the incumbent BSP Supremo as the party President, as he was also said to be in charge of party affairs since last year. Akash Anand joined the Bahujan Samaj Party in 2016. During the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, he was listed as one of the star campaigners for his party. He held major responsibilities in the recently concluded four state assembly elections, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The party gained success to a considerable extent in holding its support base and secured two seats in Rajasthan.Anand’s visibility within the BSP circle, along with his padayatra in Rajasthan’s Alwar in 2022, elevated his prominence. These reports of his elevation further gained momentum within the party, as they look ahead to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, which are now just five months away.For those unversed, on the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar in 2022, 28-year-old Akash Anand participated in a 13-km “Swabhiman Sankalp Yatra” in Alwar. He was actively involved in BSP’s election campaign in Rajasthan in 2019, rallying support for the Samajwadi Party-BSP-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance.Earlier, he also led the party’s 14-day ‘Sarvajan Hitay, Sarvajan Sukhay Sankalp Yatra’. He came into the media spotlight when Mayawati announced the inclusion of her nephew in the Bahujan Samaj Party movement. His debut political rally took place in 2019, where he urged voters to support the Samajwadi Party-BSP-Rashtriya Lok Dal alliance. It coincided with a 48-hour campaign ban imposed on Mayawati by the Election Commission.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

My gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continuous guidance in transforming our state,” on social media and the Congress leader picked it as an opportunity to target the state government. By the comment, Karti Chidambaram wanted to imply that it is just a hollow promise and that the plant will not come up in Assam.However, the BJP leaders as well as netizens responded strongly to the attack. The Assam chief minister promised to call him as soon as the plant is established in the state. He tweeted, “Yes. I will. Promise”Yes . I will .

The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.”He further charged, “You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money can’t come now, because you breached your promise to them,” arguing that the ambitious initiative of the central administration was bound for a massive failure. Meanwhile, his predictions didn’t come to fruition and with 1,124 crore United Payments Interface (UPI) transactions in November this year, the nation’s digital payments through UPI surpassed the 11 Billion threshold for the second consecutive month. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) released data showing that these transactions were up 54% from the 730.95 crore transactions that the payments network registered in November 2022. Chidambaram had argued that small traders like vegetable sellers will never be able to accept cashless payments, but now every single roadside stall has small boards displaying their QR codes enabling them to receive payments via UPI.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ",‘Jamiat gave you wrong information’: Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demands apology from Kapil Sibal for claiming that Assam was part of Myanmar,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-leader-debabrata-saikia-asks-kapil-sibal-to-apologise-for-claiming-that-assam-was-part-of-myanmar/,"Debabrata Saikia wrote that the incorrect representation of Assam history by Kapil Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam.Days after Senior Supreme Court advocate Kapil Sibal sparked a controversy by claiming that Assam was originally a part of Myanmar, Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demanded an apology for distorting history. The leader of the opposition in Assam has written a letter to former Congress leader Kapil Sibal in this regard.Debabrata Saikia wrote that this incorrect representation of Assam history by Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam. “It seems the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and AAMSU might have provided you with incorrect information about Assam history and your team has failed to cross check the data before presentation,” he wrote. AAMSU stands for All Assam Minority Students’ Union.Assam Congress Legislative Party Leader Debabrata Saikia has written a letter to Kapil Sibal to apologize publicly to people of Assam. Sibal, who was a Union Minister several times during Congress govt, had himself said in Supreme Court that Assam was under Myanmar in the past. pic.twitter.com/L3ypEAEnE7Debabrata Saikia is MLA from Nazira constituency and the son of former Assam chief minister late Hiteshwar Sarikia.Explaining the contention that Assam was part of Myanmar is wrong, the Congress leader wrote, “The history of Assam is the history of a confluence of the Austroasiatic, Tibeto- Burman (Sino-Tibetan), Tai and Indo-Aryan cultures. The Ahom kingdom ruled Assam for six centuries and unified Assam. Although invaded over centuries, it was never a vassal or a colony to an external power until the third Burmese invasion in 1821, and subsequently the British ingress into Assam in 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War. The colonial era began with the establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826.”The Congress leader added, “Therefore, Assam was never a part of Myanmar and this comment from a senior statesman like you have hurt the pride and emotion of indigenous people of Assam.” Asking Kapil Sibal to withdraw the comments made in the Supreme Court, Debabrata Saikia also asked him to issue an apology to the people of Assam for distorting the history of Assam. “In view of this, I request you to kindly withdraw the statement and render a public apology before the public of Assam for mis-representation of Assam’s glorious history,” he wrote.Kapil Sibal made the controversial comments on 7th September in Supreme Court while opposing petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955.The Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 provides a different cut-off date for immigrants to be considered illegal immigrants. As per this, all foreigners who entered Assam on or before 25th March 1971 will be granted Indian citizenship, against the cut-off date of 19th July 1949 for the rest of the country.While arguing against the petitions, Kapil Sibal said that history of Assam is complicated as it was part of Myanmar which was later handed over to the British. Sibal also claimed that migration to Assam can’t be mapped, as ‘no migration can ever be mapped’.Kapil Sibal said in the apex court, “If you look at the history of Assam, it is impossible to figure out who came when. Assam originally was a part of Myanmar, and it was way back in 1824 after the British conquered a part of it. A treaty was entered into and that is how Assam was handed over to the British.”What Sibal said was incorrect, because while the Burmese army occupied Assam for a very brief period of time, that led to the first Anglo-Burma war that ended in 1826, Assam was never a part of Assam. The Treaty of Yandabo was signed between Myanmar and British India after Myanmar lost the war, under which Myanmar ceded control of Assam and Manipur to British government.Before Burma occupied Assam in 1821-1822 that lasted till 1826 during the war, it was never a part of any other country in recorded history. Assam, previously known as Pragjyotishpur and Kamrup, is being ruled by local rulers for thousands of years, and the state, along with neighbouring states, are part of the greater Indian culture from pre-historic times.Earlier Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma slammed Kapil Sibal for the comment, saying that those who do not know history should not make such statements.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"5 December, 2023 ","BJP increases vote share in Telangana but fails to win even as anger brewed against KCR: How it got the chemistry wrong, not mathematics",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-increase-voteshare-telangana-fails-win-anger-kcr-result-analysis/,"The anger against KCR was real. So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023.At one of the pre-2019 meetings in Hyderabad, a BJP karyakarta stood up and asked the leader presiding that meeting – All these years, we have been dancing in front of the party office to celebrate victories in other states. When will we dance at our office to celebrate our victories in our state? The hall reverberated with claps, specifically at the tone and manner in which the question was posed – a tone steeped in anguish yet passionate to put everything at stake so that he could dance for the said reason. For many decades leading up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this dance eluded the karyakarta. Hence the anguish. They saw real hope post-2014. Hence the excitement. The passion was always there. It was the direction that they were looking for. And the karyakartas got their first opportunity to dance when the BJP won an unprecedented 4 Lok Sabha seats for the first time in Telangana. The first step towards the ultimate dream of capturing power in Telangana was made. Bandi Sanjay Kumar was made President of the party. The second step was made. The party won the all-important Dubbaka bye-poll. Third step. The party stormed the GHMC polls in an unprecedented manner. Fourth step. The party President started his padayatra, right from Owaisi’s bastion. He stood right before Charminar and made thousands of karyakartas chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Shree Ram – something people thought was never possible. Yeah yeah – he got “communal” and all that. But you need to know about Owaisi’s bastion to understand the monumental scale of what the karyakarta felt when Bandi Sanjay did what he did, on the day he started his padayatra. Fifth step. A big leap.  KCR fired one of his best lieutenants – Eatata Rajendar. The BJP convinced him to join them. He did and won the all-important Huzurabad bye-election. The stride of the steps was just increasing. The BJP held its national executive in Hyderabad and then held a massive public meeting – the crowd was so huge that the Prime Minister was pleasantly surprised and patted Bandi Sanjay on his back for it. Small gesture, but gave much-needed fuel to continue the pace of the steps being taken for the ultimate goal – power in Telangana in 2023. A Congress MLA resigned and joined the BJP, thus prompting a bye-election. Rahul Gandhi’s famed BJ Yatra was passing through the state when this bye-election was happening. KCR sent 80 of its MLAs to this one constituency to defeat the BJP. Against such strong odds, the BJP still put up a great fight despite losing this seat. A setback but definitely not the end of the road. Mysteriously, very mysteriously, this setback became the end of the road for the BJP’s rise in the state!The karyakarta was flabbergasted when Bandi Sanjay’s term was not extended after his 3-year term ended in March 2023. Yes, missteps were made. The mighty BJP could have easily groomed Bandi Sanjay better when certain issues were being brought to the fore. It is still an abiding mystery why the central unit of the party could not find the right resources to groom a fledgling state unit. It’s not as if this is something new for a party like the BJP. They have tremendous experience and accessibility to resources to handle situations like this. The backlash from the karyakarta at removing Bandi Sanjay from the position wasn’t anticipated by the central unit. I find it very hard to believe though – for a party like the BJP that thrives on feedback, it is tough to believe that they didn’t anticipate this. For a party like the BJP that did what they did in MP and Chhattisgarh, it is indeed a mystery as to why they gave up on Telangana. Yes, we can list out all the missteps the party took in the run-up to the 2023 elections. We can talk about the mathematics of the election. In fact, I started this article to explain the mathematics behind BJP’s loss. Using the below graphic, I wanted to explain how the party that took GHMC by storm in 2020 has failed woefully in 2023 in the exact same area. I wanted to refer to the increase in overall vote percentage for the party; the victory in the northern areas of Telangana etc. And then I read this beautiful post written by a Twitter handle – Gems of KCR. This is when it dawned upon me that the BJP lost this election because it faltered on chemistry, not on the mathematics of the election. Who is the person behind GemsOfKCR?I'm a common man, hailing from a humble family background from rural Telangana, fought for my village's issues. In 2016 questioned BRS MLA in public and asked him to solve my village problem. He has promised to solve but he didn't.Instead of…The anger against KCR was real (we explained in multiple articles here on OpIndia why people are angry). So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023. This election is BJP’s loss more than the Congress’s victory (not to take away credit, but Congress’s rise only coincided with BJP’s downfall). The karyakarta who wanted to dance the ultimate step in 2023 will now have to wait till for 2028 for the next chance. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"5 December, 2023 ","Lies, falsehoods, and blatant propaganda: Bloomberg article by Ruth Pollard is a symphony of seething and coping after BJP’s electoral victory in 3 states",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/lies-propaganda-bloomberg-article-ruth-pollard-after-bjps-electoral-victory-in-3-states-modi/,"Pollard forgets that the partners of the Indo-Pacific Quad are not doing a favor on India by 'allowing' to be in the Quad. India is the only nation in the Quad which has fought battles with China in recent years. India is the only nation among Quad partners that shares a land border with China, 3500 km of land border, no less. And the fact that the ""Indo"" in the Indo-Pacific is the Indian Ocean Region, where India has a massive coastline and is the dominant maritime power.The rise of the political force that is the Bharatiya Janata Party under Modi’s leadership has been providing employment opportunities to a lot of columnists and Left-liberal propagandists around the world for nearly a decade now. An entire cabal of Left-liberal ‘analysts’, self-proclaimed ‘intellectuals’ and columnists keep themselves gainfully employed by writing doom and gloom pieces against India, its so-called downfall to an imaginary abyss of misery because that is what their Leftist ecosystem, and Western paymasters love to read. The whole system works like the fanbase of a fantasy universe. The doom and gloom never come. Modi keeps winning election after election, India prospers faster and faster and keeps rising as a major global power, contrary to everything that the Leftists have been predicting (wrongly) for nearly a decade. But there is just no course correction. The higher-ups pay for fantasy pieces hating on Modi, so the columnists of the bottom keep producing the lies, again and again. The ecosystem survives on Modi hate and India hate. The latest in this series is another word salad of lies and falsehoods published in Bloomberg, written by Ruth Pollard. The article, titled “India’s identity is more hardline Hindu than ever“, doesn’t even know how to deal with the reality that Modi is set to win another term in office. In desperation, the author has jotted down some points and tried very hard to paint a picture of doom and gloom with so many lies and blatant misinformation that the result is a pathetic rant, not even worthy of being called an opinion. Pollard begins by noting down the BJP’s 3 key objectives. And acknowledges that 2 of them have already been achieved. She adds that BJP came to power with 3 major promises:Here is how Pollard has lied through her teeth in this article. What is surprising is that publications like Bloomberg do not even engage a minimal editorial scrutiny or basic fact checks before publishing utter nonsense. Pollard claims that Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only ‘Muslim majority state’ was “forcibly brought under the control of the federal government in 2019”. Pollard has tried to create the idea that Jammu and Kashmir was somehow NOT a part of India and under India’s territorial and administrative sovereignty, just because it was ‘Muslim majority’. The abrogation of Article 370 that allowed Jammu and Kashmir to TEMPORARILY have its own laws and penal code was legal, constitutional, and was done in the democratically elected Parliament, by the power vested on the government by the people of India. It was supported by a majority vote of the Members of Parliament, which includes representatives from the region and has been upheld by all Indian laws.Whatever made Ruth Pollard believe that India cannot give the residents of Jammu and Kashmir the same rights that are enjoyed by all other Indians, is certainly derived from similar-level trash op-eds by her fellow Left propagandists and not rooted in an actual understanding of Indian laws and constitutional process. The Bloomberg columnist peddles utter lies on the Uniform Civil Code next. She insinuates, out of nothing, just her imagination, that the Uniform Civil Code, which by its very definition means a single, uniform code for all Indian citizens, will be unfair to Muslims. She then peddles total lies to justify that conjecture, that Modi will somehow sneak in loopholes that would allow Hindus to carry on their “worst practices”, like the dowry system and allowing only sons to inherit property while taking away the right of polygamy from Muslims. Anyone with an iota of understanding of Indian laws will know that Hindus of the country are the only community who do not get any special rights to carry on with their existing social ills. All Hindu women are entitled to inherit property, by Indian law. The practice of dowry, which is not limited to Hindus alone, is a punishable crime under Article 498A which has been called ‘too strict’ and to some extent even ‘unfair’ because of the amount of power it gives to women. However, Hindus are prohibited from practicing polygamy, unlike Muslims, and unlike Muslims, Hindu families cannot deprive their daughters of property rights.The columnist claims that the Ram Mandir is being built by the Modi government after ‘Hindu extremists’ tore down a 16th-century mosque, and the riots that followed, caused ‘mostly Muslims’ to die. The blatant lie has been told so smoothly that for clueless readers, who are obviously the target audience of the Bloomberg article, it would appear that the cruel Hindus of India demolished a holy Islamic site and forcibly are building a temple over it. She does not bother to mention that the site was ‘Ram Janmabhoomi’, the birthplace of Lord Ram, where a temple existed for centuries before Islamic rulers demolished it. It does not mention that the Hindus, despite their population majority and political power, waited patiently and fought a legal battle for several decades to claim ownership of the site. It does not even mention the thousands of Hindus who were gunned down by state police of ‘secular governments’ for trying to protest against the desecration of their sacred land. It also does not mention that the Muslims were given an alternate site to build their mosque, which they accepted. The next cycle of frustration of the author is displayed through a geopolitical point of view. She is angry at the USA, Japan, and Australia for not bullying India. She is also irritated at the fact that India, despite having the ‘Hindu’ Modi in power, is considered an important Quad ally by these nations for their desire to counter China. Like many Left liberal columnists, Pollard forgets that the partners of the Indo-Pacific Quad are not doing a favor on India by ‘allowing’ to be in the Quad. India is the only nation in the Quad which has fought battles with China in recent years. India is the only nation among Quad partners that shares a land border with China, 3500 km of land border, no less. And the fact that the “Indo” in the Indo-Pacific is the Indian Ocean Region, where India has a massive coastline and is the dominant maritime power, not to mention one of the strongest naval forces in the world. Someone should ask these columnists how exactly they plan to exclude India from the Indian Ocean Region. That ocean is called the “Indian” ocean for a reason after all. The article concludes with some hard swallowed cope. It admits reluctantly that India is the fastest-growing economic power and investors are increasingly looking to put money in India rather than China. It acknowledges that Modi is set to win another term in office, and the sadness in tone is palpable when the author writes “Modi is a force to be reckoned with”, to finish her article.

"4 December, 2023 ",Ravish Kumar’s bizarre rant: Ex-NDTV journalist says Shivraj Chouhan defeated Narendra Modi in the MP assembly election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ravish-kumar-shivraj-chouhan-narendra-modi-mp-election/,"It is a well-known fact that ground reporting is the cornerstone of credible journalism. However, Ravish Kumar's analysis lacked ground reporting as he admitted not going to Madhya Pradesh.The landscape of Indian politics is ever-evolving. The narrative surrounding the elections is extensively complex for the citizens to decipher. Thus, sharp and knowledgeable electoral analysts are essential for the world of media. However, sometimes, the hate and apathy of the analysts make it challenging to give a fair reasoning for the outcome of the elections. One such analysis of Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections has been done by “infamous” journalist-turned-YouTuber Ravish Kumar. While he tried to provide a “unique perspective” of the MP election results, a critical examination of his 20-minute-long rant revealed certain aspects that merit questioning.Firstly, Ravish Kumar selectively emphasised particular aspects of the elections, such as posters and social media posts. He constructed a narrative of Shivraj Singh Chouhan being sidelined within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), based on selected social media posts and posters.However, they are only a tiny fragment of a larger, sophisticated political mosaic. It is a well-known fact that ground reporting is the cornerstone of credible journalism. However, Ravish Kumar’s analysis lacked ground reporting as he admitted not going to Madhya Pradesh to sniff out the ground narrative and realities that often shape the election outcomes.Ravish Kumar assumed that the media reports were based on the “inside knowledge” of the party that some journalists have. It became another point of contention in his analysis. He implied an intentional sidelining of Chouhan for sympathy, a claim based on pure speculation. This kind of assumption risks oversimplifying the multifaceted nature of the political decisions that the party takes within the organisation. Ravish Kumar also ignored the dynamic interplay of the various factors, including the work done by the state government and how the central government played a role in implementing different schemes.His analysis also underestimated the genuine influence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the psyche of the voters, especially in a state like Madhya Pradesh, where BJP has ruled for over 19 years. In a way, Kumar criticised the BJP for relying heavily on Modi’s face in the election campaigning. However, he forgot that every national political party, whether BJP, Congress, or even AAP, brings their top leaders into the play during campaigning.PM Modi’s appeal transcends regional boundaries. It has been pivotal in multiple electoral victories, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. His presence in the political landscape during campaigning cannot be ignored and dismissed. Furthermore, Lok Sabha elections 2024 are approaching fast, and the five-state assembly elections are seen as precursor for the General Elections. It was essential for the BJP to understand how ‘Modi Magic’ is playing its role in the hearts of the voters. The results of the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh elections made it clearer how the BJP should play its cards for the General Elections.Ravish Kumar completely ignored the strategic decisions made by the political parties. He acknowledged that knowing everything inside the party office is impossible but continued to form a perspective around op-eds and social media posts. How can a seasoned “journalist” like Ravish Kumar forget that the media is biased? They publish op-eds and reports based on their political leaning. How can someone like Ravish Kumar forget that the media ran similar reports of differences between UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and PM Narendra Modi just before the UP Assembly Elections?BJP’s decision not to project a local face for the Chief Minister’s position was a calculated move. It reflects a deeper understanding of the political terrain and the party’s electoral strategy. Elections are complex battles. Every action has to be precise, as a wrong placement of a pawn can finish the game in seconds. Ravish’s analysis lacked the understanding of the nature of the game-play that the BJP had for the MP election.Ravish asserted that Shivraj Singh Chouhan‘s local initiatives played a vital role in the election’s outcome. However, he failed to recognise that the voters of the states under the BJP are not limited to state issues. They know the importance of having the same party at the center and in the state assembly. Various factions, including national-level governance and leadership credibility, often influence the voters’ decisions.In a diverse and dynamic country like India, forming a narrative based on social media posts and a few op-eds is impossible. The ground-level approach is a must to understand the background so that one can create the right direction in reaching a conclusion about the results. Ravish’s analysis lacked that critical aspect and showed how distanced he was from reality. Most of the voters are not on social media.4,34,23,475 (Four Crores, thirty-Four Lakhs, Twenty-Three Thousand, Four Hundred and Seventy-Five) votes were cast in the MP elections. Only a fraction of them are influenced by the social media posts on X and Facebook, which were the basis of Ravish’s analysis that Chouhan was “sidelined”. The ground reality in most of the cases is different.Ravish Kumar serves the Hindi-speaking viewers. While his followers navigate the shadows of political narratives based on his videos, it is imperative to understand the importance of a holistic and nuanced understanding of the complex narrative dance of the Indian elections. Ravish Kumar failed in it, and he failed his viewers in that motion.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur.

"10 December, 2023 ","‘Rebel’ Washington Post reporter plans hitjob on Indian OSINT handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, gets exposed instead: What happened",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-reporter-pranshu-verma-planning-hitjob-osint-handle-disinfo-lab/,"As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India inch closer, Western media cartels and other vested interests are increasingly targeting those exposing anti-India narratives on social media.On Friday (8th December, US local time), American political commentator Jack Posobiec took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform that a reporter from the leftist media outlet The Washington Post was soliciting information about Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’The ‘reporter’ was identified as Pranshu Verma, a tech ‘journalist’ who started working with The Washington Post in February 2022. He had reached out to Jack Posobiec in the hopes of deterring the American political commentator from sharing informative posts of ‘Disinfo Lab.’ “We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab,” Pranshu Verma revealed his plans to carry out a hit job on the Indian OSINT handle. “Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he told Jack Posobiec.Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0Without furnishing any evidence, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ claimed, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?”Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.Although Pranshu Verma writes mundane articles on technology, he was roped in by The Washington Post to disseminate anti-India propaganda.In January this year, he romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in KashiIn his article in January 2023, Pranshu Verma relied on a database provided by ‘DOTO’ to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India. ‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. Coincidentally, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ is now hounding the same Indian OSINT handle that uncovered the dubious nature of his news report.Verma’s story is a desperate attempt to paint ‘rising hatred in India’ and one of the ‘evidences’ he has quoted is the DOTO database. DOTO was fabricating numbers of ‘atrocities’ on minorities in India.AFTER our expose, DOTO first REVISED its database and later DELETED!(4/n) pic.twitter.com/sVpCEs6QvTAround the same time he was soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab’ from Jack Posobiec, ‘rebel’ Pranshu Verma staged a one-day strike against his employer The Washington Post over lack of ‘fair wages.’“Today I walked off the job with more than 700 of my Washington Post colleagues because the company is breaking the law and bargaining in bad faith,” he had tweeted on Thursday (7th December).Thrilled to see so many colleagues on the picket line today. pic.twitter.com/nicoMxMimz“Respect our @PostGuild picket line: Avoid Washington Post journalism on Dec. 7. Thrilled to see so many colleagues on the picket line today,” he said in another tweet.As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India inch closer, Western media cartels and other vested interests are increasingly targeting those exposing anti-India narratives on social media.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.TMC’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha after the Ethics Committee tabled its report on her corruption and bribery. She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this?

Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.”TMC MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from Lok Sabha.""The souls of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be crying,"" says BSP MP Danish Ali.""A sitting member (Moitra) was expelled from Parliament without being given a chance to defend herself,"" states Prof. Saugata Roy.""Parties of… pic.twitter.com/drzhLQDJyETMC MP Saugata Roy said, “A sitting member (Moitra) was expelled from Parliament without being given a chance to defend herself. All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you.

Shameful.”Without due process and being given a chance to defend herself #MahuaMoitra is expelled. ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no? Think.”So a 104 page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at 12 noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs…Earlier today, the Ethics Committee report probing ‘Unethical Conduct’ of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra in the “cash for query” case that was tabled in the Lok Sabha recommended that Moitra “may be expelled” from the Lok Sabha and called for an “intense, legal, institutional inquiry” by the central government in a “time-bound manner”. Moitra is facing a CBI inquiry over serious allegations of corruption, and bribery where she has herself admitted that she had given her login credentials to businessman Darshan Hiranandani to pose questions on her behalf, questions that were related to Hiranandani’s business interests and were targeted to his rival Adani Group. Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

During his lifetime, Refaat was known for peddling pro-Hamas propaganda and disseminating anti-Semitic tropes. Following his death, Alt News co-founder Mohammed Zubair tried to garner sympathy for Refaat and demonise the State of Israel. The dubious ‘fact checker’ also made no references to the tweets and misleading claims of the deceased ‘journalist’.Mohammed Zubair retweeted an emotional post of Refaat Al-Areer and attempted to pass him off as an ‘academic’ resisting the supposed ‘atrocities’ of the Jewish State.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"5 December, 2023 ","Rajdeep Sardesai tortures data to death, and compares apples with oranges, to try and give hope to Congress after party’s drubbing in assembly elections",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rajdeep-sardesai-data-congress-assembly-elections-positive/,"If Sardesai's logic is to be considered, Congress should have won at least 14 seats in Rajasthan in 2019, 20+ seats in MP, and 8 seats in Chhattisgarh, but in reality the numbers were 0,1, and 2 respectively. On 3rd December, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Assembly Elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh by a wide margin. Congress, which won all 3 states when elections were held in 2018, lost in all 3 states.However, some individuals cook up theories to show the results that these assembly elections will favour Congress in the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. One such individual is India Today’s anchor Rajdeep Sardesai, who came up with a bizarre interpretation of the results to spin the narrative in Congress’s favour.On 5th December, Sardesai published an “analytic” post on the numbers from the Assembly Elections and compared it to the General Election results from 2019 so that Congress came out in a better position.Interesting Data point: In 2019 BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, Cong 0; based on Vidhan Sabha 2023 results , BJP would win 14 Lok Sabha seats , Cong 11 in 2024. Madhya Pradesh: BJP…According to him, in 2019, the BJP won all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan, and Congress failed to win a single seat. Based on the 2023 Assembly Election results, the BJP will win 14 seats, and Congress will win 11 in 2024.Similarly, he claimed that BJP won 28 seats in Lok Sabha in Madhya Pradesh 2019 and Congress won only one. Based on the 2023 Vidhan Sabha results, the BJP would win 24, and the Congress would win 5 in the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections.In Chhattisgarh, he asserted that BJP won 9 seats and Congress won 2 seats in 2019. Thus, the BJP would win eight, and Congress would win three seats in Lok Sabha 2024.In Telangana, the BJP had won 4, and the Congress won 3 in 2019, which would tune into nine seats for Congress and 0 for the BJP.Sardesai attempted to spin the Congress loss in the assembly elections as a positive outcome for the party in the upcoming General Elections. Selectively using the 2023 Assembly Election results compared to the 2019 General Election results would not work, as Sardesai claimed. Let’s talk numbers. According to the data provided by the Election Commission of India (ECI), in the 2013 Madhya Pradesh Assembly Elections, the BJP won 143 seats, and the Congress won 71 seats. In the 2018 MP Assembly Elections, BJP won 109 seats, and Congress won 114 seats. In the 2023 Assembly Elections in MP, BJP won 163 seats, and Congress won 66 seats. Now, coming to Lok Sabha Elections in 2014, BJP won 27 seats, and Congress won 2 seats. In the 2019 General Elections, BJP won 28 seats, and Congress won 1 seat.In the 2013 Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections, BJP won 50 seats, and Congress won 38 seats. In the 2018 Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections, BJP won 15 seats, and Congress won 68. In the 2023 Assembly Elections in Chhattisgarh, BJP won 54 seats, and Congress won 35. Now, coming to Lok Sabha Elections in 2014, BJP won 10 seats, and Congress won 1 seat. In 2019, BJP won 9 seats and Congress won 2 seats.In the 2013 Rajasthan Assembly Elections, BJP won 163 seats, and Congress won 21 seats. In the 2018 Assembly Elections in Rajasthan, BJP won 73 seats, and Congress won 100 seats. In 2023, the BJP won 115 seats, and Congress won 69 seats. In the Lok Sabha Elections 2014, BJP won 25 seats, and Congress won zero seats. In 2019, the BJP won 25 seats, and the Congress won zero seats.If Sardesai’s logic is to be considered, Congress should have won at least 14 seats in Rajasthan in 2019, 20+ seats in MP, and 8 seats in Chhattisgarh, but in reality the numbers were 0,1, and 2 respectively. But in reality, Congress nosedived in the Lok Sabha 2019 elections. Based on the numbers, it is clear that the voting dynamics are entirely different regarding Lok Sabha and Assembly Elections. Voters chose the national issues during the Lok Sabha elections and favoured BJP in all three states in the last two Lok Sabha elections, irrespective of the voting patterns in the assembly elections.Sardesai cherry-picked the data and claimed there could be a way to defeat PM Modi’s influence on the Lok Sabha Elections. He misinterpreted and misrepresented the prevailing political sentiment. His analysis hinged on the assumption that the 2023 Assembly would translate into the Lok Sabha outcomes in 2024, ignoring the unique dynamics of state and national elections.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"2 December, 2023 ",UP: Pet cat bites Imtiazuddin and his son Azim in Kanpur; both die of rabies within a week,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/up-pet-cat-bites-man-and-his-son-kanpur-dehat-both-die-of-rabies-within-a-week/,"In a tragic incident that has instilled fear in the Kanpur Dehat region, a father and son lost their lives to a cat bite in Kanpur Dehat. Imtiazuddin, a resident, had warmly raised a cat in his home, with the entire family showering it with affection. Unfortunately, the family’s world turned upside down when the pet cat fell victim to a stray dog bite, unknowingly contracting rabies. Ignorant of the rabies symptoms, Imtiazuddin and his son Azim were bitten by the ailing cat. Within a week, the devastating consequences of rabies claimed both of their lives.The family had no clue that their cat, which they played with and fed, would lead to a tragic outcome. While having fun, the cat occasionally scratched and bit its owners. Imtiazuddin’s son Azim worked in Noida. He came to the home on a short leave. during this time, this pet cat bit him.Azim’s health worsened, and a medical examination revealed rabies symptoms. Despite treatment, 24-year-old Azim passed away, leaving the family in grief. Just a week after Azim’s tragic death, his father Imtiazuddin began showing signs of rabies. The local community and family members were gripped with panic witnessing Imtiazuddin’s distressing condition. Upon seeking medical attention, it was confirmed that he, too, was suffering from rabies. Despite undergoing treatment, Imtiazuddin passed away merely seven days after the loss of his son.The neighbourhood is now in a state of panic as fear of stray dogs and cats grips the community. Families that once kept pets are hastily arranging to relocate their animals. This is particularly seen in those households with dogs or cats. The two deaths in a family within a week due to rabies have left the area in shock.Rabies is a preventable viral disease most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. The RABV virus infection is the root of the ailment. The virus infects the central nervous system of mammals which ultimately results in brain disease and death. It causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in humans and other mammals.Rabies was historically referred to as hydrophobia (fear of water) due to the symptom of panic when presented with liquids to drink. It is spread from the saliva of infected animals. The majority of rabies in the United States are linked to skunks, raccoons, bats and foxes. However, dogs continue to carry the rabies virus in many other nations, including India, and dog bites are the leading cause of rabies-related deaths in humans worldwide.The animals most likely to spread the rabies virus to people include pets and farm animals like cats, cows, dogs, ferrets, goats, horses and wild animals like bats, beavers, coyotes, foxes, monkeys, raccoons, skunks and woodchucks.The epidemic of rabies in IndiaThe number of human deaths globally due to dog-mediated rabies is estimated to be 59,000 annually. India is responsible for 36% of rabies-related deaths worldwide, according to the statistics of the World Health Organisation. The National Rabies Control Programme recorded 6644 medically suspected cases and fatalities of rabies between 2012 and 2022. Recent cases of rabies death which got wider media attention were from Meerut, Chennai, and Ghaziabad.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Where is the money – What happens to the cash recovered by Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax department during raids,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/what-happens-to-cash-recovered-during-ed-raids-cbi-income-tax/,"First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Income Tax (IT) Department conduct multiple raids every year, resulting in the recovery of unaccounted cash worth crores. With swanky photographs of seized money arranged to form letters like “E” and “D” to denote ED during raids, the question arises: What happens to the cash recovered by the agencies during raids?When the ED, CBI, or IT Department seizes unaccounted money, they cannot just keep it on their office premises. First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The actual process of seizing the cash starts from here. The State Bank of India is called in to count the seized cash. Simultaneously, a list of seized cash is prepared with the details of the recovered amount in specific denominations such as Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100, Rs 50 and so on. Based on the amount, the bank deploys multiple cash counting machines to ensure smooth and quick completion of the counting process.Once the counting is complete, the cash is sealed in the boxes in the presence of independent witnesses. The cash is then taken to the SBI branch, where it is deposited under the agency’s Personal Deposit (PD) account. Later, the cash is moved to the central government’s treasury.Notably, cash can be used only once the case is over in the court of law. Neither the ED, nor the bank, nor the government has the right to use the money for any purposes while the case is sub-judice. The agency issues a provisional attachment order, and an adjudicating authority must confirm the attachment within six months. This order ensures that the accused cannot benefit from the seized cash. Notably, the agency can only hold onto the cash for 180 days. During that time, the agency has to prove the validity of the seizure. In case the agency fails to do so, the money gets returned to the accused automatically.How the money will be used depends on the outcome of the case. If the accused acquits, the cash gets returned; otherwise, if convicted, the money becomes government property.Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax Department can raid, investigate and seize property in cases of money laundering, scams, tax fraud, or irregularities.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Who is Dhiraj Prasad Sahu – The Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand at the centre of the historic Income Tax raid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-prasad-sahu-rajya-sabha-mp-jharkhand-it-raid/,"Dhiraj Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the Indian National Congress, the grand old party, is once again surrounded by controversies. The party has yet to recover from the crushing defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. It is now facing intense scrutiny as the Income Tax (IT) Department has recovered hundreds of crores of unaccounted cash from properties linked to its Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.By 9th December, the IT Department recovered nearly Rs 300 crores from the premises linked to Sahu, and further recovery is still underway. Congress Party officially distanced itself from the controversy and claimed it had nothing to do with the cash recovered by the IT Department. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party’s General Secretary in Communications, Jairam Ramesh, claimed that the Indian National Congress has nothing to do with the businesses run by its Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand. The senior Congress functionary added that only the accused in the case, Sahu, could explain the source for vast piles of cash reportedly seized from his properties and demanded an explanation from Sahu.The money recovered by the IT department is said to be linked to Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Private Limited and its related organisations, where Sahu is a partner. Over nineteen bags containing cash were taken from the home of a certain Bunty Sahu, who was assigned to oversee the management of liquor facilities in the Odisha regions. Three dozen machines were deployed to count the cash. Reports suggest some of the machines broke down during counting, resulting in a delay in completing the process. Reportedly, Bhagat Beherea, the Regional Manager of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, said that the bank had received 176 bags containing money in total. Fifty workers and twenty-five counting machines have been deployed to count the currency notes.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner in Baldev Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd, a group company of Budha Distilleries. He has been a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand since 2009. Sahu’s family has been linked to Congress for a long time.Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Slowly and steadily, he climbed the party ladder and served as office-bearer in the Lohardaga district and later in the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee.In 2009, he was elected Rajya Sabha member for the first time in a bypoll. He was re-elected for the second term in 2010. In May 2018, he became the third time Rajya Sabha member of Congress from Jharkhand.According to his profile on the Rajya Sabha website, his family has been associated with Congress since independence. He was part of “Jail Bharo Aandolan” in 1978. He has asked 630 questions in Rajya Sabha since 2010, with the latest being related to the Kavach Safety System, procurement of paddy, losses due to damage to national highways, accidents in coal mines, privatisation of airports and more.In November 2022, Sahu participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, yet another attempt of the Congress Party to “launch” Gandhi into politics and project him as Prime Minister candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. In a post on X, Dhiraj Sahu shared some photographs from the Yatra.भारत जोड़ो यात्रा के दौरान कुछ पल।#BharatJodoYatra@bharatjodo @INCIndia @INCJharkhand pic.twitter.com/g3lYQSRoBkLater, in February 2023, Sahu published a video from the Yatra and wrote, “Historic Bharat Jodo Yatra ended up winning the hearts of Indians.

I feel the Income Tax department should transfer the case to the Enforcement Directorate considering the magnanimity of the situation.” In a post on X, he wrote, “The Rajya Sabha MP of Congress, Dhiraj Sahu, is declared as a partner in two companies, Baldev Sahu & Company and Shiv Prasad Sahu & Sons, whose shares have been accounted for at Rs 350 crores till now. The disclosure of 20 per cent of these shares is pending, and it is suspected to be undisclosed or benami, which will be revealed through an investigation. A raid at his residences in Ranchi and Lohardaga resulted in the recovery of Rs 20 crore in cash and assets, including gold, silver, and diamonds worth Rs 150 crore.

"10 December, 2023 ","Mahua Moitra was Vice President at JP Morgan, but that post doesn’t mean what one may imagine. Here is the truth about fancy designations...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohua-moitra-was-vice-president-at-jp-morgan-that-does-not-mean-she-was-in-very-senior-position/,"A vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. On 8th December (Friday), the Lok Sabha voted in favour of expelling the Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on the recommendation of the Ethics Committee against the TMC leader in connection with the cash-for-query scam case. Since her ouster, several netizens have flaunted her past credentials as the Vice President at the Investment Banking giant JP Morgan and Chase. Notably, it is touted among the big five in the Investment banking sector. Supporting the accused TMC leader, some social media users claimed that she is innocent of the cash-for-query scam case and alleged that it is an attempt to silence her. They argued that Moitra left her lucrative and ‘distinguished’ position at one of the biggest investment banks (I-bank) to enter politics and serve the people of her constituency.इस खूबसूरत तस्वीर को गौर से देखिये….इसे देखकर पता लगता है क्या कि इस महिला ने करोड़ो रु की बैंक की नौकरी एक झटके में समाज सेवा के लिए छोड़ दी थी…इस तस्वीर से यह भी नही लगता कि इस महिला की एक स्पीच से पूरी बीजेपी के फासीवाद को नंगा कर दिया था ये तस्वीर यह भी नही बताती यह… pic.twitter.com/dojLHNKUusAdditionally, they asserted that her lavish lifestyle is a result of her previous role as the VP at JP Morgan, a high-paying and consequential post. Furthermore, they claimed that her ‘senior’ position in the top Investment Bank underscores her leadership qualities, which have rattled her naysayers insinuating that she has a brain of her own and didn’t need to take cues from others to shape her decisions countering the allegations that she accepted bribery to ask pliable questions. However, several netizens have pointed out that the senior-most designation in the I-banks is not a rarity linked with high calibre and exemplary growth. Instead, it is a general trend in Investment Banks to dole out fancy designations to scores of employees, sometimes even in the hundreds to thousands. This is done for various reasons, including massaging the egos of their employees, non-cash retention tools to assuage lower paychecks, or creating an impression on clients/customers, among other considerations.Some fools are under the impression that Mahua Moitra once being ""vice president"" at some bank is a huge dealAt big investment banks, almost everyone is a ""vice president""Goldman-Sachs for example reportedly has almost 12,000 ""vice-presidents."" pic.twitter.com/maCl78aqCB""Vice President"" in an investment bank is not what you think it is https://t.co/8jHDYA0QFG pic.twitter.com/Qmik1Yrw4LIt is generally assumed that an official with senior-most designations like Vice-President, Director, or Managing Director would be among the highest-ranking decision-makers in any company or country, possibly holding the 2nd or 3rd authority in the entity. However, things are different in I-Banks, and according to reports, as high as 30-40% or even higher of officials enjoy these fancy titles of VP, Director, or MD without their designations granting them as much power, privilege, or reflection of experience as their contemporary designation holders in non-I-Banks get.In March 2012, Goldman Sachs, in a court case, noted that the plaintiff Greg Smith, an estranged VP of the firm, was one of 12,000 VPs in their organisation. Back then, US media also estimated that 40% of Goldman staff were VPs as it was estimated to have 2,400 managing directors!While it was a decade-old case, things have not changed much, and recent estimates also highlight that there are between 10,000 and 12,000 Vice Presidents employed at Goldman Sachs, FourWeekMBA reported in October this year.Reuters in November this year reported that Goldman Sachs would promote 608 executives to managing directors next year. These would be fewer than the 643 senior bankers it elevated two years ago, according to a company memo. Notably, the Wall Street firm announces managing director promotions every two years. The number of promotions this year is the lowest since Goldman promoted 465 in 2019, before the pandemic, the report added.Similarly, on 4the July 2022, the global accounting and consulting firm EY became the latest firm to promote thousands of its employees to “partner” without offering them a share of profits, the Financial Times reported. However, outside the non-I-banking terminology, a ‘partner’ is often assumed a co-founder or large shareholder which is not the case in I-banks.   However, this phenomenon isn’t confined to I-banks alone. According to a report from the Small Investor Protection Association, there are approximately 121,000 registered financial professionals in Canada. The majority of them, classified as dealing representatives, are essentially salespeople licensed to sell financial investments. Only about 4,000 among these registered financial professionals bear a fiduciary duty, a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. Meanwhile, the exact figures and percentages of individuals bearing these inflated corporate titles may vary, the prevalence of fancy designations, as exemplified by Goldman Sachs, is a common practice in the sphere of investment banking. This broad trend is observed in I-banks worldwide, including those in India. This means that I-banks are plentiful of Vice-presidents, directors, and managing directors.A consultant from a financial services company, Jerome Tillier, conducted a test and discovered a significant number of hits when searching for the keyword ‘bank vice-president’ in LinkedIn’s search box. He pointed out that this number is larger than the population of Malta. Similarly, when searching for the keyword ‘Vice President JP Morgan Chase’ in India, the results yield thousands of hits, featuring dozens of Vice Presidents, Managing Directors, and other senior positions available regularly.Furthermore, in a wrongful termination lawsuit between Bank of America and an Indian-American, Padmanabhan Ramanathan, at the California Court of Appeals in 2007, the bank’s legal representation made an unusual assertion. As detailed by the California Business Litigation Blog, the counsel contended that the bank has the authority to label any employee, “including janitors, maintenance workers, everyone,” as “vice-presidents” if it so chooses. The assertion that a bank can make even a janitor as VP aptly explains why an Investment bank VP or MD doesn’t immediately translate to authority, experience, and command in that domain or career growth viz-a-viz equivalent title holder employed in non-I-banks. It is important to note that the abundance of such posts has diminished the perceived authority associated with these positions. Evidently, a vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. This begs the question: What accounts for the abundance of these fancy titles in certain fields like Investment banking?Foremost, Indian and India-based banks adopted a well-established practice observed in American banks, particularly investment banks (I-banks). Evidently, post-liberalisation, American banks introduced their HR norms to India, and the influence of peer pressure compelled Indian private banks and I-banks to conform to these practices.A major reason for these inflated Corporate titles is to stoke egos. A bank executive said, “Fancy designations address a human need for validation by employers.”The head of one of the largest MNC I-banks in India noted, “The MD designation gives social status…being an MD symbolises seniority outside.”Another reason for so many VPs, MDs, and Directors is to make an impression on customers.K Sudarshan is a managing partner, Asia at EMA Partners International which is a global executive search firm.Explaining the rationale and power wielded by such fancy titles, Sudarshan said, “Designations like MD, VP are not jobs, but grades that reflect seniority. VPs are just fancy titles on visiting cards for market-facing executives… VPs are ubiquitous and the title does not mean anything and has nothing to do with the job one is doing…even the person managing in-house tech support can be called MD, technology.”VP & Head – HR, India Factoring and Finance Solutions, Gauri Das explains that companies try to go innovative with designation, wherever required, and use it as a “retention tool”.According to Das, another reason for fancy designation is to compensate for low payouts by giving a very high social status through designations. This is because afancy and inflated title does not cost money and is not necessarily linked with the paycheck, making it an easy tool for employee happiness.As per experts, one of the reasons can also be to create a buzz on social media. Das added, “Fancy designations help you get many eyeballs.” Job titles like Customer Service Evangelist, Marketing Dynamo, Head of First Impressions (Receptionist), Opportunity Creator (Business Development), and Master of Disaster (the one who helps federal agencies with information to manage calamities) among others are an example of it.In a sector where customer perception is crucial, a headhunter said, “A customer meeting a vice-president is going to be a bit impressed…and a company looking for an acquisition likes the idea of liaising with an MD.”He added, “These designations are visiting card tools for banks to present a grand face to people and companies.”Meanwhile, after her education, Mahua Moitra worked as an investment banker for Investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase in New York and London. In 2009, she quit her position as one of the vice presidents of JPMorgan Chase in London to join politics, where there were thousands of VPs in the bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"8 December, 2023 ","Tamil Nadu Church groups which led Kudankulam protests, receive foreign funds even after FRCA cancellation, MP writes to MHA: Read full details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/tamil-nadu-church-groups-kudankulam-protests-receive-foreign-funds-after-frca-cancellation/,"Raghu Ramakrishna Raju revealed in the complaint to the Home Ministry on 7th December that the NGOs continue to receive foreign funds in their respective FCRA-designated bank accounts which were said to have been frozen by the government. As per the complaint the Tuticorin Diocesan Association is said to have received Rs. 4,45,07,214 in its Bank of Baroda account designated to receive foreign funds. In an update to the anti-nuclear protests from the year 2012 that were led by church groups who allegedly received illegal foreign funds for the purpose in Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, the MP of Narasapuram Lok Sabha Constituency, Raghu Ramakrishna Raju has written to the Home Ministry seeking action against large scale violation of FCRA rules and misuse of foreign funds by the Christian organizations. The letter dated 7th December demanded an investigation by the Enforcement Directorate into the matter of receipt of foreign funds by the organizations named ‘the Tuticorin Diocesan Association’ (FCRA No: 076030031) and ‘the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society’ (FCRA No: 76030038). The complaint stated that these organizations continue to receive overseas ‘donations’ despite cancelling their FCRA registrations and freezing bank accounts by the Government of India in 2015. In the year 2015, the then Minister of State for the Ministry of Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju suspended the FCRA registration of the Tuticorin Diocesan, Association and 2 other NGOs based on the adverse reports received from the intelligence agencies. The government then froze the bank accounts of the said NGOs and stated that the organizations were using foreign funds for anti-national activities. In a most significant move, the Hon'ble MP of Narasapuram Lok Sabha Constituency Sri Raghu Ramakrishna Raju wrote to Sri Amit Shah and Home Secretary for action against large scale violation of FCRA rules & misuse of foreign funds by Tuticorin Diocesan Association & its ally NGO pic.twitter.com/wy8gJbXFAVHowever, Raghu Ramakrishna Raju revealed in the complaint to the Home Ministry on 7th December that the NGOs continue to receive foreign funds in their respective FCRA-designated bank accounts which were said to have been frozen by the government. As per the complaint the Tuticorin Diocesan Association is said to have received Rs. 4,45,07,214 in its Bank of Baroda account designated to receive foreign funds. The said funds were received by the NGO from the financial year 2015-16 to 2017-18 in the name of the Welfare of Children, maintenance and construction of Orphanages. Some transactions were also made in the name of ‘Mass Intention’ which has no specific description. “A large amount of foreign funds received by the Tuticorin Diocesan Association to its ‘Frozen’ bank accounts were transferred to the individual accounts of its office bearers. The NGO also transferred the illegal money to another account with Syndicate Bank at the Tuticorin Branch. In addition, Rs. 1,25,00,000 out of the foreign funds were transferred to a few construction companies from the frozen bank account of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association post cancellation of its FCRA license. The reasons for such a transfer of amount are to be investigated,” the complaint read. Notably, it has also come to the fore that a large portion of foreign funds, around Rs 1.6 crores, received by the Tuticorin Diocesan Association after the suspension if its FCRA license has come from Apostolic Nunciature India, a diplomatic entity of the Vatican government having its office in New Delhi. The amount transferred by Apostolic Nunciature India from 2016 to 2018 was shown as a foreign contribution by the NGO in question. As per the letter copy, the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society which claims to be a sub-entity or social wing of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association (FCRA: 076030038) also received Rs 34,81,691 as foreign funds in its account after it’s FCRA license had been suspended. “The intention of the diplomatic organization to fund the NGO which has lost its FCRA license and its bank accounts were frozen by the Government of India by declaring its activities as ‘Anti-National’ should be investigated,” the MP noted in the complaint. The bank accounts of the NGO which were frozen by the government are operational even after the government action and most of the foreign funds are being obtained in the name of Child welfare activities. “This raises concerns. We request you take the necessary action by referring the matter to the Enforcement Directorate to immediately register a case in this matter and to conduct a detailed investigation of the activities of the Tuticorin Diocesan Association and Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society,” the complaint read. It is important to note that these NGOs had a major role to play in organizing and leading the protest against the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, which was developed in collaboration with Russia in the year 2011-12. The NGOs were associated with Bishop Yvon Ambroise, the Tuticorin church leader, who had been active in mobilizing popular support for the protests at Kudankulam back then. In the year 2011, the Church-sponsored rabble-rousers and hooligans delayed the critical Kudankulam power plant, hitting the country at a time when energy requirements were rapidly increasing. The majority of those who took part in the Nagercoil protest marches were from various Catholic churches. Several churches and NGOs including the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS) drew fear among the people against the nuclear facility and advised people to participate in the protests against the Kudankulam project. The Kudankulam Nuclear Power situated in the state of Tamil Nadu was conceptualized as the largest Nuclear Power plant in India with a total capacity of 6000 MW. The construction of the plant began way back in 2002 but it was marred by constant protests.This protest reached a boiling point in 2011 when the villagers reportedly feared that a Fukushima-type disaster might befall the Nuclear plant. As reported earlier, one of the prominent leaders of the anti-Kudankulam movement was the then SP Udayakumar, who led the People’s Movement against Nuclear Energy.Incidentally, this whole protest had come under suspicion way back in 2012 when there were reports about the protest being allegedly backed by the Church and various foreign parties emerged. In 2014 there were further allegations after an alleged IB report had claimed that Udayakumar had been working on the behest of various American and German entities to subvert the development of India.The then-Union Minister V Narayanasamy asserted that Bishop Yavon Ambroise of Tuticorin had received Rs 54 crore and was the driving force behind the demonstrations. Many Christian organizations, such as People’s Education for Action and Liberation and Good Vision, were identified as troublemakers by the Home Ministry. The list also included the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS). The Union Home Secretary said in 2012 that four non-governmental organizations’ bank accounts including the Tuticorin Diocese Association (TDA) and the Tuticorin Multipurpose Social Service Society (TMSSS) had been seized after it was determined that they had been utilizing money from foreign sources to fund anti-nuclear protests. The CBI filed two cases, while the Tamil Nadu police Crime Branch filed two.Moreover, in 2017, Republic TV came up with a sting operation on Udyakumar and various members of the Tamil Nadu Church, which seemed to further corroborate the “foreign-funded protest theory”.The reporters then followed the Church-backed protest angle and zeroed in on a Church in Idinthakarai which according to them was a hub of anti-nuclear protests. They reportedly stung a Parish priest named Jayakumar who managed the money used in the protest. He had selected 70 people who were set up as a front while he and the Diocese controlled things from behind the curtains. Apparently, he took care of all the protests in Idinthakarai and there were 13 other Fathers who similarly managed 13 other villages.The report also claimed that this whole church involvement was orchestrated by a Bishop who had suggested that Jayakumar operates from the background. The Bishop was incidentally the person who was withstanding all the external ‘pressure’ like the cancellation of their FCRA license.The reporters also interviewed a villager who claimed that all the NGOs were run by Bishops who paid money to Christian people if they took part in the protests. Through these sting operations, it appeared that the main motivation for the whole protest was not an aversion to Nuclear Power but a desire to earn money.The Legal Rights Protection Forum while talking to OpIndia confirmed that “the bank accounts of these NGOs were frozen by the government in the year 2015. Their FCRA license had also been canceled. However, they continue to receive foreign funding under the name of child care or ‘mass intention’ which nobody knows what it means. These NGOs undertake anti-national activities and the same was noted by the government. Strict action against such NGOs is a must,” LRPF said.

In Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, a teacher at Parsara’s Saiema Mansoor Public School has been suspended for asking a student to not use the words ‘Ram Ram’, a popular phrase to greet people. On Thursday (December 8), a Class XI student claimed that his teacher, Mohammad Adnan, declined to reciprocate his ‘Ram Ram’ greeting and instead rebuked him for it. Soon after, the incident escalated into a major controversy, with members of Hindu rights groups gathering at the school gates on Saturday (December 9) and reciting Hanuman Chalisa in protest. The matter pertains to the Chandapa police station precinct.Meanwhile, the school principal has sacked Mohammad Adnan and apologised on his behalf, promising “measures to prevent such incidents in the future.” Notably, several reports say that the teacher Mohammad Adnan not only stopped the student from saying ‘Ram Ram’ but also asked him to say “Assalam Walaikum” (Islamic greeting). Reportedly, the Saiema Mansoor Public School authorities have been pressuring Hindu students not to apply Tilak on their foreheads in addition to asking Hindu schoolgirls to wear a Hijab (Islamic veil). When the parents reached the school to confront the school management regarding this, they were allegedly mistreated and forcefully ousted from the school premises.On Saturday (December 9), Archana Verma, the district magistrate of Hathras, appointed an inquiry committee, that consisted of an SDM and a district basic education official.

The action was taken only a few days after the corresponding district magistrates in the valley warned to initiate legal proceedings against anyone disseminating false information, anti-national narratives and other materials that would disturb the tranquil atmosphere of the society. The instruction was issued last week under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) Section 144 to prevent the transmission of anything that is sensitive to certain communities or that encourages terrorism and secessionism.Legal action has been initiated against the accused for uploading hateful and abusive content as well as spreading rumours online. According to cops, three people have been identified by police named Salman Mushtaq Kuttay, a resident of Check Wangund Dooru along with Rameez Ashraf Hadi from Watnad Kokernag and Umer Farooq Ganie alias Ghazi Sir of Ratherpora Khairbugh Srigufwara. The cops mentioned that the videos posted by them on social media platforms consisted of seditious and provocative elements. A resident of Wani Mohalla Baliharan Pattan named Bilal Ahmad Wani was named by the Baramulla Police as a provocateur and rumour monger.Police in the Pulwama district’s Awantipora area filed a lawsuit against Sheeraz Ahmed Beigh of Beighpora, Awantipora for spreading inflammatory and inciting material on social media, according to the officials. According to them, the Budgam authorities in an effort to maintain peace and order enforced severe penalties on anyone who used social media sites to propagate rumours.They added that two miscreants had been apprehended and brought before the magistrate and that investigations into the matter were still underway. In a similar vein, authorities in Ganderbal filed charges against two people for posting and transmitting offensive material on social media. They were recognised as Waseem Mushtaq Malik from Safapora and Nunner Ganderbal’s Aadil Ahmed Rather. Authorities noted that it was discovered that the people were disseminating offensive material on social media and legal action has been started against both of them by the District Magistrate’s most recent order.Speaking to media in Bandipora, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir V K Birdi cautioned that anyone seen purposely or inadvertently spreading narratives linked to terrorism or anti-national sentiment as well as causing disturbances to public order would be liable to severe police action. He urged parents to keep an eye on their kids to prevent them from mistakenly or purposely spreading rumours online.Director General of Police (DGP) J&K Police RR Swain highlighted, “Under 144 Code of Criminal Procedure, we will bring a law under which any content message, video, photo, audio that can harm communal sensitivity or can threaten anyone will be a crime. You can’t forward such things too.” Kashmir Police asserted, “We urge the public to be vigilant against such individuals who spread hateful content on social media. Anyone found engaging in such activities will be dealt strictly with in accordance with the law.”Furthermore, Deputy Commissioners issued orders under section 144 of CrPC which forbids and directs the public to desist from “posting,” “uploading,” or “propagating” messages or content that glorifies terrorists and their actions, intimidates and terrorizes individuals, the general public, or specific groups within the public, and encourages or exhorts members of the public to resort to violence by inciting, encouraging, and spreading disaffection and hatred, propagates false narratives and terrorist and secessionist ideology, fosters feelings of hatred and ill-will based on religion, and is likely to disturb peace and order.

"10 December, 2023 ",Where is the money – What happens to the cash recovered by Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax department during raids,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/what-happens-to-cash-recovered-during-ed-raids-cbi-income-tax/,"First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Income Tax (IT) Department conduct multiple raids every year, resulting in the recovery of unaccounted cash worth crores. With swanky photographs of seized money arranged to form letters like “E” and “D” to denote ED during raids, the question arises: What happens to the cash recovered by the agencies during raids?When the ED, CBI, or IT Department seizes unaccounted money, they cannot just keep it on their office premises. First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The actual process of seizing the cash starts from here. The State Bank of India is called in to count the seized cash. Simultaneously, a list of seized cash is prepared with the details of the recovered amount in specific denominations such as Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100, Rs 50 and so on. Based on the amount, the bank deploys multiple cash counting machines to ensure smooth and quick completion of the counting process.Once the counting is complete, the cash is sealed in the boxes in the presence of independent witnesses. The cash is then taken to the SBI branch, where it is deposited under the agency’s Personal Deposit (PD) account. Later, the cash is moved to the central government’s treasury.Notably, cash can be used only once the case is over in the court of law. Neither the ED, nor the bank, nor the government has the right to use the money for any purposes while the case is sub-judice. The agency issues a provisional attachment order, and an adjudicating authority must confirm the attachment within six months. This order ensures that the accused cannot benefit from the seized cash. Notably, the agency can only hold onto the cash for 180 days. During that time, the agency has to prove the validity of the seizure. In case the agency fails to do so, the money gets returned to the accused automatically.How the money will be used depends on the outcome of the case. If the accused acquits, the cash gets returned; otherwise, if convicted, the money becomes government property.Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax Department can raid, investigate and seize property in cases of money laundering, scams, tax fraud, or irregularities.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

According to an ETV Bharat report, accused Esan told the police that he found several pictures on the victim’s mobile phone which she was allegedly using to blackmail him. She had also blocked his number. This allegedly infuriated the accused who then called the victim to a local fair (mela) in Fori village to meet on November 28. The accused reportedly managed to take Archana in confidence who then took her clothes off after accused Esan asked her to do so. Following that, the accused attacked the victim with a sharp object (Tangi or axe) and severed her hands.

The BJP MLA also met the victim’s father on whose complaint a case was registered against the accused.The BJP MLA has also submitted a memorandum in this regard. The victim’s father said that his daughter was going to Delhi, however, she missed the train at Ranchi Station. The victim told her father that she was staying at her friend’s house now and that she needed money. The victim’s father said that he had called Archana to come home and take some money, however, her mobile phone was switched off since then and later he received the news that a severed body had been recovered in Fori village.Meanwhile, Hindu Jagran Manch leader Sanjay Kumar Verma has called the incident a case of love jihad. He said that if the police do not conduct a proper investigation into the case, the Hindu rights organisation will demand a CBI probe.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The 51-year-old is expected to receive the esteemed honour on 10th December in Norway’s Oslo. However, she won’t be able to attend because she is imprisoned in Iran at the moment.Her 51-year-old husband and Iranian journalist Taghi Rahmani, and her younger brother Hamidreza Mohammadi, informed at a press conference in Oslo, “She is not here with us today, she is in prison and she will be on a hunger strike in solidarity with a religious minority but we feel her presence here.” Her husband stated that the strike was a show of support for the largest religious minority, people of the Baha’i faith. The strict Islamic regime persecutes and discriminates against Baha’i faith adherents. Two of the community’s prominent leaders, Mahvash Sabet and Fariba Kamalabadi, have started refusing food in protest of the persecution. Rahmani added, “She said that ‘I will start my hunger strike on the day that I am being granted this prize, perhaps then the world will hear more about it’.” The human rights advocate had reportedly begun her three-day hunger strike 24 hours before the ceremony, according to a post on her Instagram account. It read, “On the day of the Nobel Prize ceremony, I want to be the voice of Iranians protesting against injustice and oppression.” Her friends are in charge of her Instagram.She won the Nobel Peace Prize in October “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran.” She is known for her advocacy against compulsory hijab and the death penalty there and has been held at the Evin jail in Tehran since 2021.

She has been arrested 13 times, convicted five times to a total of 31 years in prison and inflicted 154 lashes.Narges Mohammadi served as the Defenders of Human Rights Center’s Vice President in the past. The Norwegian Nobel Committee unveiled it awarded the Nobel Prize to her “for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.” They noted, “Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal costs.” However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry objected to the decision and labelled it “biased and politically motivated.”Mohammadi was born in Zanjan and studied physics at the Imam Khomeini International University. She distinguished herself as a champion of women’s rights and equality while attending college. Following her graduation, she worked as an engineer and contributed reform-focused pieces to several periodicals.Nargis Mohammadi became a member of the Defenders of Human Rights Center in Tehran in 2003, which was founded by Shirin Ebadi, the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. After being apprehended for the first time in 2011, Mohammadi was given an extended jail sentence in recognition of her assistance to activists and their families. She concentrated on her opposition to the death penalty after receiving bail in 2013. She endured prison time for an additional year in 2015 after being arrested once more.She is one of the women leading the “Woman, Life, Freedom” revolution. The uprising included months-long demonstrations throughout Iran after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in custody in September 2022. The young woman had been detained after being arrested for allegedly disobeying the Islamic Republic’s rigid dress codes for women. According to their lawyer, her parents and brother, who were supposed to accept the Sakharov Prize which was given posthumously to Amini in a separate event in France on 10th December, are not allowed to leave Iran.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Who is Dhiraj Prasad Sahu – The Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand at the centre of the historic Income Tax raid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-prasad-sahu-rajya-sabha-mp-jharkhand-it-raid/,"Dhiraj Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the Indian National Congress, the grand old party, is once again surrounded by controversies. The party has yet to recover from the crushing defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. It is now facing intense scrutiny as the Income Tax (IT) Department has recovered hundreds of crores of unaccounted cash from properties linked to its Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.By 9th December, the IT Department recovered nearly Rs 300 crores from the premises linked to Sahu, and further recovery is still underway. Congress Party officially distanced itself from the controversy and claimed it had nothing to do with the cash recovered by the IT Department. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party’s General Secretary in Communications, Jairam Ramesh, claimed that the Indian National Congress has nothing to do with the businesses run by its Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand. The senior Congress functionary added that only the accused in the case, Sahu, could explain the source for vast piles of cash reportedly seized from his properties and demanded an explanation from Sahu.The money recovered by the IT department is said to be linked to Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Private Limited and its related organisations, where Sahu is a partner. Over nineteen bags containing cash were taken from the home of a certain Bunty Sahu, who was assigned to oversee the management of liquor facilities in the Odisha regions. Three dozen machines were deployed to count the cash. Reports suggest some of the machines broke down during counting, resulting in a delay in completing the process. Reportedly, Bhagat Beherea, the Regional Manager of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, said that the bank had received 176 bags containing money in total. Fifty workers and twenty-five counting machines have been deployed to count the currency notes.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner in Baldev Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd, a group company of Budha Distilleries. He has been a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand since 2009. Sahu’s family has been linked to Congress for a long time.Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Slowly and steadily, he climbed the party ladder and served as office-bearer in the Lohardaga district and later in the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee.In 2009, he was elected Rajya Sabha member for the first time in a bypoll. He was re-elected for the second term in 2010. In May 2018, he became the third time Rajya Sabha member of Congress from Jharkhand.According to his profile on the Rajya Sabha website, his family has been associated with Congress since independence. He was part of “Jail Bharo Aandolan” in 1978. He has asked 630 questions in Rajya Sabha since 2010, with the latest being related to the Kavach Safety System, procurement of paddy, losses due to damage to national highways, accidents in coal mines, privatisation of airports and more.In November 2022, Sahu participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, yet another attempt of the Congress Party to “launch” Gandhi into politics and project him as Prime Minister candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. In a post on X, Dhiraj Sahu shared some photographs from the Yatra.भारत जोड़ो यात्रा के दौरान कुछ पल।#BharatJodoYatra@bharatjodo @INCIndia @INCJharkhand pic.twitter.com/g3lYQSRoBkLater, in February 2023, Sahu published a video from the Yatra and wrote, “Historic Bharat Jodo Yatra ended up winning the hearts of Indians.

I feel the Income Tax department should transfer the case to the Enforcement Directorate considering the magnanimity of the situation.” In a post on X, he wrote, “The Rajya Sabha MP of Congress, Dhiraj Sahu, is declared as a partner in two companies, Baldev Sahu & Company and Shiv Prasad Sahu & Sons, whose shares have been accounted for at Rs 350 crores till now. The disclosure of 20 per cent of these shares is pending, and it is suspected to be undisclosed or benami, which will be revealed through an investigation. A raid at his residences in Ranchi and Lohardaga resulted in the recovery of Rs 20 crore in cash and assets, including gold, silver, and diamonds worth Rs 150 crore.

"10 December, 2023 ",Kerala: Enforcement Directorate freezes bank accounts of Abdurahiman Chenoth Thirummal who duped UAE banks of Rs 340 Crore,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ed-acts-against-abdurahiman-who-duped-uae-banks-for-rs-340-cr/,"ED said that Abdurahiman engaged in fraudulent activities by deceiving foreign banks, misappropriating funds intended for business ventures, and diverting them for his gain. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has frozen the bank accounts and confiscated property documents belonging to Abdurahiman Chenoth Thirummal, a businessman accused of defrauding multiple banks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of approximately Rs 340 crore. The ED initiated a probe following the filing of an FIR by the Chandera Police in Kasaragod of Kerala.According to this FIR filed by the Chandera police, Abdurahiman – a resident of Mettammal village in Kasaragod’s Trikaripur gram panchayat – had taken a business loan of 68.159 million Arab Emirates dirhams (AED) from the Invest Bank in Sharjah for development of his enterprise named Hexa Oil & Gas Services LLC.The bank disbursed the funds in two instalments, one in October 2017 and the other in January 2018. Although he made partial repayments, Abdurahiman still had an outstanding debt of 42.898 million dirhams or Rs 83.36 crore to the bank. In February 2021, a representative from Invest Bank lodged a cheating complaint (under Section 420 of the IPC) against Abdurahiman with the Chandera Police.In 2022, Shamsheer Sam, a 38-year-old Mogral Puthur gram panchayat resident in Kasaragod, filed a complaint with the Chandera Police. He alleged that Abdurahiman compelled him to take a personal loan of 340,000 dirhams (approximately Rs 77.24 lakh) but failed to repay the borrowed amount.According to reports, a police official from Chandera said that Abdurahiman sought relief from the High Court of Kerala and successfully obtained a stay on the police investigation in the initial case involving the alleged cheating of Invest Bank. He further informed that regarding Shamsheer Sam’s case, the police investigation uncovered inconsistencies between the statement provided to the court by Shamsher Sam and the one given at the police station. Consequently, the police submitted a report to the court reflecting these disparities, leading to the closure of the case.However, the Kochi office of the Enforcement Directorate traced the leads from the initial FIR lodged at the Chandera Police Station. On Thursday (7th December), the ED carried out search operations at eight locations linked to Abdurahiman, his wife Zareena Majeed, and their associates in Kochi, Kozhikode, and Kasaragod.While the initial complaint cited a sum of 42.898 million dirhams (Rs 83.36 crore), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) revealed that its investigation uncovered Abdurahiman’s acquisition of loans amounting to approximately 150 million dirhams (around Rs 340 crore) from various banks, including Invest Bank.ED said in its statement, “He is suspected to have diverted funds withdrawn in cash through hawala channels and invested the same in multiple companies in the fields of construction, media, chemical industry and information technology. Our searches have revealed the modus operandi of this large-scale cross-border offence of money laundering.”ED said that Abdurahiman engaged in fraudulent activities by deceiving foreign banks, misappropriating funds intended for business ventures, and diverting them for his gain. The agency also informed that several incriminating documents and electronic devices were seized during the raids. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has directed the freezing of Rs 3.58 crore in the bank accounts of Abdurahiman and other implicated individuals in the case. Additionally, it has confiscated the documents of his real estate holdings and shares in affiliated companies.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

While sharing the video, IDF said, “Hamas members beat civilians and steal the humanitarian aid they received from international organizations—facilitated by Israel.”Hamas members beat civilians and steal the humanitarian aid they received from international organizations—facilitated by Israel.Hamas puts its terrorist goals over Gazans' needs. pic.twitter.com/lFuaWU0bdx“Hamas puts its terrorist goals over Gazans’ needs,” the Israel Defense Forces emphasised.Israel has time and again accused the ‘irredeemably flawed’ United Nations Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNPRA) of fuelling the ongoing conflict in Gaza and instilling hatred against the Jewish State.The question remains whether funds meant for the ‘welfare’ of Palestinians are diverted for terror activities. A case in point is that of a Gaza aid worker named Mohammed Halabi, who transferred $50 million of humanitarian funds to Islamic terror outfit Hamas. The funds were used to build tunnels and rockets to attack the State of Israel. Israel’s Shin Bet intelligence service described him as “a major figure in the terrorist/military arm of Hamas”. Halabi, who worked for the global charity ‘World Vision’ transferred 60% of the funds to Hamas terrorists through a “sophisticated and systematic apparatus.”A report by The Times of Israel stated, “Israel closely supervises aid to try to ensure it bypasses the terror group. But the Hamas-run government benefits from foreign countries footing the bill for schools, hospitals and infrastructure, allowing it to conserve its own resources, including the taxes and customs it collects.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Shah Rukh Khan, Ajay Devgn, and Akshay Kumar get legal notices for endorsing Pan Masala",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/srk-ajay-devgn-akshay-kumar-pan-masala/,"This comes after lawyer Motilal Yadav filed a petition voicing concerns about the alleged involvement of celebrities and dignitaries, particularly 'Padma Awardees,' in advertisements or endorsements of specific products or items that are causing harm to the public's health.In response to a contempt petition, Deputy Solicitor General SB Pandey informed the Allahabad High Court’s Lucknow bench on Friday (December 8) that on October 20, the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) served notices to actors Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, and Ajay Devgn for promoting tobacco brands. The bench has set the hearing for May 9, 2024, after hearing the submission.This comes after lawyer Motilal Yadav filed a petition voicing concerns about the alleged involvement of celebrities and dignitaries, particularly ‘Padma Awardees,’ in advertisements or endorsements of specific products or items that are causing harm to the public’s health.A court of Justice Rajesh Singh Chauhan had earlier directed the central government to decide the representation of the petitioner, who had argued that action should be taken against artists and dignitaries who received high-profile accolades but were advertising for gutkha companies.The petitioner argued that a representation was made to the government on October 22, however, no action was taken.Following the hearing of the contempt petition, the high court issued a notice to the central government’s Cabinet Secretary. The Centre has issued show cause notices to Akshay Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan, and Ajay Devgn, according to Deputy Solicitor General SB Pandey, who briefed the High Court on Friday.Moreover, the court was informed that actor Amitabh Bachchan also sent a legal warning to a gutkha brand that was broadcasting his advertisement even though he had terminated his contract with it. It is worth noting that Bachchan withdrew from a paan masala advertising campaign in October 2021 after receiving flak from fans over a commercial that aired featuring him. The actor had announced in his blog post titled “The Office of Mr Amitabh Bachchan” that he has terminated his contract with the gutkha company.Notably, actors Akshay Kumar alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Ajay Devgn were seen in the advertisements of the brand Vimal. This sparked controversy, and Akshay Kumar resigned as Vimal’s brand ambassador last year after receiving criticism from his fans. Previously, he had signed up as a brand ambassador for the company’s Elaichi products. However, Vimal also makes tobacco products, and his endorsement of the brand was seen as an endorsement of those products. In October this year, Kumar refuted a media report claiming that he is returning as the brand ambassador for Vimal Pan Masala.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Magill gave the response all the while smiling and smirking sparking anger amongst netizens.The President of the University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill has resigned. This comes just days after her controversial testimony at a congressional hearing about the rise in antisemitism on campuses.Magill issued a statement about her resignation. She stated, “It has been my privilege to serve as President of this remarkable institution. It has been an honour to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn’s vital missions.”According to the website of the University of Pennsylvania, Magill has “voluntarily” tendered her resignation. She will remain a tenured faculty member at the law college, Penn Carey Law.Meanwhile, Magill will stay on until an interim president is appointed.Netizens have welcomed the development. X, formerly Twitter, user Dr. Phil, who boasts a 1.4 million following on the social media platform said he was relieved that Magill has resigned.I am relieved that Liz Magill resigned as President of @Penn.

This week, I viewed a highly restricted @IDF video of the Oct 7 Hamas massacre. I was sickened by video images I can never “unsee” and appalled by university presidents, like Liz Magill, who are OK with calls for Jewish genocide on their campuses. @MeritStMedia,” he wrote.Another X user named Libs of TikTok with 2.7 million followers pointed out how Magill was smirking while she answered during the Congressional hearing.Liz Magill, President of @Penn has resigned. This was her smirking as she explained that calling for the g*noc*de of Jews on campus doesn’t violate any policies. pic.twitter.com/TKstRdIJ0uThe user wrote, “Liz Magill, President of @Penn has resigned. This was her smirking as she explained that calling for the g*noc*de of Jews on campus doesn’t violate any policies.”Calls were being made for Liz Magill’s resignation after her shocking testimony at the congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus which drew widespread condemnation.On 5th December, the Presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania were confronted by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik during the hearing over the issue of rising cases of antisemitism on their campuses.During the hearing, the Presidents of all three universities including Liz Magill refused to condemn the calls for the genocide of Jews on their campuses as bullying and harassment, when asked to offer a simple “yes” or “no” answer on whether advocating for the murder of Jews would violate the University’s bullying and harassment policies.Congresswoman Stefanik asked, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Penn’s rules or code of conduct? Yes or no?” To this, Magill replied with a smirk that raised eyebrows, “If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment.” Magill maintained that if antisemitic speech becomes conduct, that is, committed in action, only then does it amount to harassment.The White House also rebuked the presidents of the universities. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, “It’s unbelievable that this needs to be said: calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country. Any statements that advocate for the systematic murder of Jews are dangerous and revolting — and we should all stand firmly against them, on the side of human dignity and the most basic values that unite us as Americans.”On 7th December, Magill issued a clarification saying that her statement was focused on the University’s long-standing policies “aligned with the US Constitution which say that speech alone is not punishable”.She stated, “In that moment, I was focused on our University’s long-standing policies, aligned with the US Constitution, which say that speech alone is not punishable. I was not focused on, but I should have been, the irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. It’s evil plain and simple. I want to be clear, the call for genocide of Jewish people is threatening, deeply so. It is intentionally meant to terrify people who have been subjected to pogroms and hatred for centuries and were the victims of mass genocide in the Holocaust. In my view, it would be harassment or intimidation.”Calls for Presidents of Harvard and MIT universities are also being made on social media.University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill was forced to step down.She didn’t really say anything different than the President of Harvard, Claudine GayClaudine must also go pic.twitter.com/nRdTya6uWcThe credibility of Ivy League institutions in the United States has come into question following the rise in antisemitic demonstrations, actions and even violence going unabated on their campuses in light of the Israel-Hamas war.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Nachan was convicted in a bomb blast in 2002 in Mumbai's Ville Parle, Mumbai Central, and Mulund station, which resulted in dozens of deaths.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday arrested 15 terrorists in connection with raids conducted over 44 locations across Karnataka and Maharashtra in an ISIS terror conspiracy. The ISIS terrorists arrested had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as ‘Al-Sham’, which is a reference to ‘liberated zones’ in Syria.Interestingly, one of the 15 terrorists arrested by the premier investigating agency is Saquib Nachan, a radical Islamist with a history of involvement in multiple terror cases. Nachan was convicted in a bomb blast in 2002 in Mumbai’s Ville Parle, Mumbai Central, and Mulund station, which resulted in dozens of deaths.Former secretary of the banned terror outfit ‘Students Islamic Movement of India’, which was later rechristened as ‘Indian Mujahideen’ to evade punitive actions by intel agencies and evade arrests, Nachan was a BCom graduate and ran a business of land development before plunging into the world of Islamic terrorism.Son of a Zill Parishad chief and social worker, Nachan owned vast tracts of ancestral land in and around Borivali village, Padgah, Thane district.Nachan gained infamy after being involved in multiple terror blasts in Mumbai in just four months. He was accused of a blast at Mumbai Central railway station that injured 25 people in December 2002. A month later, he was accused of another bomb blast, this time in Vile Parle which killed 1 and injured 25 others. In March 2003, Nachan was named in a bomb blast at Mulund station that killed 11 and injured 82. He was arrested shortly thereafter by Mumbai Police in April 2003 and held in prison for over 7 years. In 2011, he managed to secure bail but was arrested months later in connection with an attempted murder of VHP activist and lawyer Manoj Raicha.The former secretary of SIMI was finally convicted in March 2016 for possessing weapons under the anti-terror law and sentenced to 10 years in jail. He served one year and 8 months in jail as a convict, while the remainder of the term as undertrial to come out free in November 2017.However, Nachan’s rearrest indicates that a decade in prison had done little to discourage recidivism and instil fear in him of the law of the land.Earlier in August this year, the NIA arrested Saquib Nachan’s son in connection with the ISIS terror module that was busted by police in Pune in July 2023.Shamil Nachan, a resident of Padgha in Thane, was in touch with the other arrested accused identified as Zulfikar Ali Barodawala, Mohammed Imran Khan, Mohammed Yunus Saki, Simab Nasiruddin Kazi and Abdul Kadir Pathan, along with other suspects, the agency had said then. On 9th December, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced that it raided 44 locations in Maharashtra and Karnataka in which they arrested 15 ISIS terrorists of the ISIS Maharashtra module. As per the initial investigation of NIA, the arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone‘ and as ‘Al-Sham’. Seemingly areas in Syria are referred to with such notations. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence to strengthen the Padgha base, NIA revealed in its official press release.NIA investigations have further revealed that the accused, all members of the ISIS Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali. From there, they had hatched the conspiracy to spread terror and carry out acts of violence across India, the agency noted. The NIA also pointed out that the accused were also aiming to wage a war against the Indian government. The press release reads, “Pursuing the path of violent Jihad, Khilafat, ISIS, etc., the accused had aimed to disturb the peace and communal harmony of the country and to wage a war against the Government of India.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","As US accuses India of planning to kill terrorist Pannun, read how Spain expelled 2 American spies for infiltrating Spanish secret service & arrested...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/spain-expelled-2-american-spies-for-infiltrating-spanish-secret-service-arrested-2-moles/,"Spain has arrested two of its secret service agents who were recruited American spies to leak information to US in exchange of money. Spain govt has condemned the developmentThe US authorities claimed that earlier this year they foiled a purported assassination plot of Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, alleging the involvement of Indian government officials/agents in the act. Additionally, the US argued that this purported attempt to kill ‘US citizens’ on US soil by India or its government officials impinged on its sovereign authority. While the US allegations are still under investigation, Spanish media has revealed that at least two US officials/agents were caught bribing Spain’s secret service officers. Subsequently, they were discreetly expelled from Madrid on Thursday (7th December), as reported by Spanish media El Pais. As per reports, at least two U.S. agents stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, who were directly involved in recruiting spies of Spain’s Secret Service CNI, have been discreetly expelled from Spain. The revelation that US officials were bribing two agents from Spain’s CNI intelligence service to provide classified information has led to diplomatic friction between Madrid and Washington. According to a Spanish media report, Spain’s Foreign as well as Defence Minister reprimanded the US ambassador separately and sought an explanation for such an act from the US side against its NATO ally and friendly nation, Spain. Responsible for overseeing the CNI, Spanish Minister of Defense Margarita Robles summoned the U.S. ambassador to Spain, Julissa Reynoso, to her office and sought an explanation.According to sources, when U.S. Ambassador Reynoso was summoned by Minister Robles, she said that she was not aware of the case. She allegedly claimed that the U.S. agents who had bribed the Spanish spies were working independently of her. She argued that the purported program was launched before current President Joe Biden assumed power at the White House and for reasons unknown, it had been maintained until now.The same sources added that Reynoso apologised for what happened and promised utmost collaboration with the ongoing investigation. The case has left the U.S. in an embarrassing situation, the report noted.The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, José Manuel Albares, also spoke with Reynoso and expressed the Spanish government’s unease over the revelations, the report added citing government sources. Albares agreed to expel at least two American spies who were involved in recruiting and bribing the CNI agents. However, some sources claim that there were more spies. The spies were expelled discreetly, as Washington rushed to remove them. The report added that such actions are considered hostile and are not expected between two allies. Additionally, it also pointed out that the case is a very serious matter as it involves recruiting secret agents of a host state to betray their own country which is considered an openly hostile act. It noted that such actions may be taken with enemy or adversary governments, but never with friends and allies.According to El Confidencial news website, the two CNI agents were arrested in September for leaking top secret data to the US. The investigation started when during a CNI security check, it was found that the two Spanish agents had accessed classified information not pertinent to their duties, and they were not authorised to know. Subsequently, the internal investigation confirmed that at least one of the agents had been recruited by U.S. spies to gather secret information in return for a large sum of money. The agent was positioned as a middle-ranking official in the secret service. According to CNI sources, one of the agents held the role of an area chief within a section of the intelligence division, while the other agent worked as their assistant. After concluding its investigation, the CNI director, Esperanza Casteleiro, brought the case to the attention of the Prosecutor’s Office at Spain’s highest court, the National Assembly. The case was subsequently transferred to the Prosecutor’s Office of the High Court of Madrid, as deemed the competent authority. The Madrid tribunal then complained to the investigative courts of Plaza de Castilla.As per reports citing sources, it was during this period that the Spanish government opted to disclose the investigation’s findings to the United States and condemned the incident.Launching a scathing attack on their ‘ally’ US, sources noted, “What do Americans have to pay for if we give them everything they ask for?” They asserted that Spain openly collaborates with the United States, and always exchanges information. The sources added that the number of times in which Spain has refused to share information of interest to Washington is “between one and zero.”Meanwhile, the Madrid court sealed the investigation, issuing orders for the arrest of the two purported CNI spies and the search of their residences. Both individuals were subsequently taken to the Estremera prison module in Madrid. However, the CNI assistant was released last month but his superior remains incarcerated.Both the arrested CNI agents working for the US are accused of the crime of revealing secrets. They could face a jail term of 6-12 years under Article 584 of the Penal Code. The rule punishes “a Spaniard who, with the purpose of helping a foreign power, association or international organization, procures, falsifies, disables or discloses information classified as reserved or secret, that is likely to harm national security or national defense.”However, reports indicate that this is not the only instance where the Spanish secret service has reported one of its agents for espionage. In an earlier incident in 2007, the CNI initiated a case against former spy Roberto Flórez, who had served at the center from 1992 to 2004. The action was taken following the discovery of classified documentation in his residence and two apartments he owned in Puerto de la Cruz in Tenerife. The CNI also confiscated a letter directed to the Russian secret services, wherein Flórez proposed collaboration in exchange for an initial payment of $200,000. While there was no conclusive evidence that Flórez had handed over the classified documents, the Provincial Court of Madrid handed him a 12-year prison sentence in 2010. Subsequently, the Supreme Court reduced this sentence to nine years.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"10 December, 2023 ","‘Rebel’ Washington Post reporter plans hitjob on Indian OSINT handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, gets exposed instead: What happened",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-reporter-pranshu-verma-planning-hitjob-osint-handle-disinfo-lab/,"As the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in India inch closer, Western media cartels and other vested interests are increasingly targeting those exposing anti-India narratives on social media.On Friday (8th December, US local time), American political commentator Jack Posobiec took to X (formerly Twitter) to inform that a reporter from the leftist media outlet The Washington Post was soliciting information about Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’The ‘reporter’ was identified as Pranshu Verma, a tech ‘journalist’ who started working with The Washington Post in February 2022. He had reached out to Jack Posobiec in the hopes of deterring the American political commentator from sharing informative posts of ‘Disinfo Lab.’ “We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab,” Pranshu Verma revealed his plans to carry out a hit job on the Indian OSINT handle. “Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he told Jack Posobiec.Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0Without furnishing any evidence, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ claimed, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?”Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.Although Pranshu Verma writes mundane articles on technology, he was roped in by The Washington Post to disseminate anti-India propaganda.In January this year, he romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in KashiIn his article in January 2023, Pranshu Verma relied on a database provided by ‘DOTO’ to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India. ‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. Coincidentally, The Washington Post ‘journalist’ is now hounding the same Indian OSINT handle that uncovered the dubious nature of his news report.Verma’s story is a desperate attempt to paint ‘rising hatred in India’ and one of the ‘evidences’ he has quoted is the DOTO database. DOTO was fabricating numbers of ‘atrocities’ on minorities in India.AFTER our expose, DOTO first REVISED its database and later DELETED!(4/n) pic.twitter.com/sVpCEs6QvTAround the same time he was soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab’ from Jack Posobiec, ‘rebel’ Pranshu Verma staged a one-day strike against his employer The Washington Post over lack of ‘fair wages.’“Today I walked off the job with more than 700 of my Washington Post colleagues because the company is breaking the law and bargaining in bad faith,” he had tweeted on Thursday (7th December).Thrilled to see so many colleagues on the picket line today. pic.twitter.com/nicoMxMimz“Respect our @PostGuild picket line: Avoid Washington Post journalism on Dec. 7.

He shared, “Tata Group has submitted an application to set up a semiconductor processing plant in Assam with an investment of Rs 40,000 crore. This will be a game-changer. My gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his continuous guidance in transforming our state,” on social media and the Congress leader picked it as an opportunity to target the state government. By the comment, Karti Chidambaram wanted to imply that it is just a hollow promise and that the plant will not come up in Assam.However, the BJP leaders as well as netizens responded strongly to the attack. The Assam chief minister promised to call him as soon as the plant is established in the state. He tweeted, “Yes. I will. Promise”Yes . I will . Promise https://t.co/9i8AxgNbmsBJP national general secretary BL Santhosh called out the “arrogance” of the Congress politician and asserted, “This arrogance has cost you Tamil Nadu outside Shivagangai.

That Assamese people aren’t capable to build a semi conductor facility ? https://t.co/R5QX7DilyDTamil Nadu BJP president Annamalai posted a hard-hitting tweet, saying, “Dynast Thiru @KartiPC & his father Thiru @PChidambaram_IN do not often step out of their palace to witness the reality & transformation the country is witnessing today.” He quoted how P Chidambaram had in 2017 said that vegetable sellers will never accept online payments, and mentioned how UPI has proved him wrong.Dynast Thiru @KartiPC & his father Thiru @PChidambaram_IN do not often step out of their palace to witness the reality & transformation the country is witnessing today. “Go to a village fair, buy potatoes & tomatoes and pay ₹7.50 by a credit card.

So, another failed challenge to the long list of failed challenges for the Father-Son duo in the making.”The official spokesperson of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Telangana unit referred to the recent electoral defeat of former state chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and charged, “We had a son of the chief minister just like you. Now, he is in a farmhouse without power. To question is something legitimate, but arrogance and shamelessness will be answered with the ballot. By the way, your party is nonexistent in the Northeast due to the same arrogance.”We had a son of CM just like you.Now he is in farmhouse without power.To question is something legitimate, but arrogance and shamelessness will be answered with ballot.BTW your party is nonexistent in North East due to same arrogance. https://t.co/n35MdBs3EYMeanwhile, social media users also raised questions about his statement and denounced him for the same.

You didn’t learn from it.”Even your ""papa"" once mocked about digital India…You didn't learn from it…One person told the Lok Sabha MP to email his curriculum vitae (CV) to the Assam chief minister for the job. “Do mention your skill, I mean, other than being a gardener during the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) era,” he added.Email your CV to him for the job. Do mention your skill, I mean, other than being a gardener during the UPA era..Notably, Karti Chidambaram is the son of former Union Finance Minister in the Congress government and current Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram who took a jab at the present government’s ‘Digital India’ campaign in 2017.Interestingly, the senior Chidambaram vehemently criticised the Modi government’s ‘Digital India’ program earlier in 2017 in a speech in Rajya Sabha by claiming that it was impossible to discuss a cashless economy in a rural area. “You go there and the people ask ‘What digital?’ It is very difficult to get away with a lie. The best way to do so is to utter the biggest lie.”He further charged, “You speak about digitisation. First, teach that to the RBI. Every rupee has come back, except in Bhutan, Nepal and NRIs, whose money can’t come now, because you breached your promise to them,” arguing that the ambitious initiative of the central administration was bound for a massive failure. Meanwhile, his predictions didn’t come to fruition and with 1,124 crore United Payments Interface (UPI) transactions in November this year, the nation’s digital payments through UPI surpassed the 11 Billion threshold for the second consecutive month. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) released data showing that these transactions were up 54% from the 730.95 crore transactions that the payments network registered in November 2022. Chidambaram had argued that small traders like vegetable sellers will never be able to accept cashless payments, but now every single roadside stall has small boards displaying their QR codes enabling them to receive payments via UPI.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ",‘Jamiat gave you wrong information’: Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demands apology from Kapil Sibal for claiming that Assam was part of Myanmar,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/congress-leader-debabrata-saikia-asks-kapil-sibal-to-apologise-for-claiming-that-assam-was-part-of-myanmar/,"Debabrata Saikia wrote that the incorrect representation of Assam history by Kapil Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam.Days after Senior Supreme Court advocate Kapil Sibal sparked a controversy by claiming that Assam was originally a part of Myanmar, Congress leader Debabrata Saikia demanded an apology for distorting history. The leader of the opposition in Assam has written a letter to former Congress leader Kapil Sibal in this regard.Debabrata Saikia wrote that this incorrect representation of Assam history by Sibal is very unfortunate and it has hurt the pride and prestige of Assam. “It seems the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and AAMSU might have provided you with incorrect information about Assam history and your team has failed to cross check the data before presentation,” he wrote. AAMSU stands for All Assam Minority Students’ Union.Assam Congress Legislative Party Leader Debabrata Saikia has written a letter to Kapil Sibal to apologize publicly to people of Assam. Sibal, who was a Union Minister several times during Congress govt, had himself said in Supreme Court that Assam was under Myanmar in the past. pic.twitter.com/L3ypEAEnE7Debabrata Saikia is MLA from Nazira constituency and the son of former Assam chief minister late Hiteshwar Sarikia.Explaining the contention that Assam was part of Myanmar is wrong, the Congress leader wrote, “The history of Assam is the history of a confluence of the Austroasiatic, Tibeto- Burman (Sino-Tibetan), Tai and Indo-Aryan cultures. The Ahom kingdom ruled Assam for six centuries and unified Assam. Although invaded over centuries, it was never a vassal or a colony to an external power until the third Burmese invasion in 1821, and subsequently the British ingress into Assam in 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War. The colonial era began with the establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826.”The Congress leader added, “Therefore, Assam was never a part of Myanmar and this comment from a senior statesman like you have hurt the pride and emotion of indigenous people of Assam.” Asking Kapil Sibal to withdraw the comments made in the Supreme Court, Debabrata Saikia also asked him to issue an apology to the people of Assam for distorting the history of Assam. “In view of this, I request you to kindly withdraw the statement and render a public apology before the public of Assam for mis-representation of Assam’s glorious history,” he wrote.Kapil Sibal made the controversial comments on 7th September in Supreme Court while opposing petitions challenging Section 6A of the Citizenship Act. A five-judge constitution bench of the Supreme Court is hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955.The Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 provides a different cut-off date for immigrants to be considered illegal immigrants. As per this, all foreigners who entered Assam on or before 25th March 1971 will be granted Indian citizenship, against the cut-off date of 19th July 1949 for the rest of the country.While arguing against the petitions, Kapil Sibal said that history of Assam is complicated as it was part of Myanmar which was later handed over to the British. Sibal also claimed that migration to Assam can’t be mapped, as ‘no migration can ever be mapped’.Kapil Sibal said in the apex court, “If you look at the history of Assam, it is impossible to figure out who came when. Assam originally was a part of Myanmar, and it was way back in 1824 after the British conquered a part of it. A treaty was entered into and that is how Assam was handed over to the British.”What Sibal said was incorrect, because while the Burmese army occupied Assam for a very brief period of time, that led to the first Anglo-Burma war that ended in 1826, Assam was never a part of Assam. The Treaty of Yandabo was signed between Myanmar and British India after Myanmar lost the war, under which Myanmar ceded control of Assam and Manipur to British government.Before Burma occupied Assam in 1821-1822 that lasted till 1826 during the war, it was never a part of any other country in recorded history. Assam, previously known as Pragjyotishpur and Kamrup, is being ruled by local rulers for thousands of years, and the state, along with neighbouring states, are part of the greater Indian culture from pre-historic times.Earlier Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma slammed Kapil Sibal for the comment, saying that those who do not know history should not make such statements.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

According to the press release, the arrested accused include the leader and head of the ISIS module. As per NIA, he was administering ‘Bayath’ – an oath of allegiance to Khalifa of ISIS to the recruits. On 9th December, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced that it raided 44 locations in Maharashtra and Karnataka in which they arrested 15 ISIS terrorists of the ISIS Maharashtra module. As per the initial investigation of NIA, the arrested accused had self-declared the village of Padgha in rural Thane as a ‘liberated zone‘ and as ‘Al-Sham’. Seemingly areas in Syria are referred to with such notations. They were motivating impressionable Muslim youth to relocate to Padgha from their place of residence to strengthen the Padgha base, NIA revealed in its official press release.NIA Swoops Down on 44 Locations in M’Rashtra & K’Nataka, Arrests 15 ISIS Operatives of ISIS Maharashtra Module pic.twitter.com/bcvJBOIA3MTaking to X, the security agency shared a press release that revealed shocking details about the terror module. According to the press release, the arrested accused include the leader and head of the ISIS module. As per NIA, he was administering ‘Bayath’ – an oath of allegiance to Khalifa of ISIS to the recruits. NIA investigations have further revealed that the accused, all members of the ISIS Maharashtra module, were operating from Padgha-Borivali. From there, they had hatched the conspiracy to spread terror and carry out acts of violence across India, the agency noted. The NIA also pointed out that the accused were also aiming to wage a war against the Indian government. The press release reads, “Pursuing the path of violent Jihad, Khilafat, ISIS, etc., the accused had aimed to disturb the peace and communal harmony of the country and to wage a war against the Government of India.”Notably, earlier this morning, the NIA team raided 44 locations that were spread across Padgha-Borivali, Thane, Mira Road, and Pune in Maharashtra, as well as Bengaluru in Karnataka. During these raids, they arrested 15 accused for promoting terror and terror-related acts and activities of the proscribed organisation.These raids are a part of NIA’s ongoing efforts to disrupt and demolish the attempts of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to carry out violent acts of terror and take innocent lives. The agency also seized huge amounts of unaccounted cash, firearms, sharp-edged weapons, incriminating documents, smartphones, and other digital devices during these raids. As per NIA investigations, the accused, operating on the direction of their foreign handlers, had been actively involved in various terrorist activities, including the fabrication of lEDs, for furthering the violent and destructive agenda of ISIS.According to NIA, Saqib Nachan is the main accused and the leader and head of the ISIS module. He was also administering the ‘Bayath’ (oath of allegiance to the Khalifa of ISIS) to the persons joining the proscribed organisation, as per NIA investigations.The press release added that ISIS is a Global Terror Organisation (GTG), also known as Islamic State (IS) / Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) / Daish / Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) / ISIS Wilayat Khorasan/Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham Khorasan (ISIS-K)). The outfit has been spreading its terror network in India by putting in place localised ISIS modules and cells in various States of the country.In recent months, NIA has conducted large-scale raids and busted different ISIS modules along with arresting several terror terrorists in the ISIS terror conspiracy case. This is part of the agency’s bid to scuttle the organisation’s heinous and violent anti-India agenda. As part of NIA’s crackdown, the agency registered a case against the ISIS Maharashtra module earlier this year. Since then, the NIA has undertaken strong and concerted actions to destroy the various ISIS modules and networks operating across the country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","Urdu portal ‘Rekhta’ promotes a book glorifying Islamist Ilmuddin, who killed Mahashay Rajpal in 1929 over ‘blasphemy’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/urdu-portal-glorifies-promotes-a-book-on-islamist-ilmuddin-who-killed-mahashay-rajpal-over-blasphemy/,"The current edition of this book with Rekhta is made available by Jamia Hamdard in Delhi. The information surfaced as the annual three-day festival of the Urdu-promoting organisation - Jashn-E-Rekhta - is going on from 8th December to 10th December at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. Urdu literary web portal Rekhta operated by Sanjiv Saraf’s non-profit organisation Rekhta Foundation is promoting the biography of an Islamist killer who had killed a Hindu man for ‘blasphemy’ against the Prophet Muhammad. Rekhta portal displays a book in its list titled ‘Sawaneh Umri Ghazi Ilmuddin Shaheed’, which means ‘a biography of martyr Ilmuddin’. This book is written by Mohammad Afzal Hashmi. The 102-page Urdu book was originally published in 1930 by Munshi Azizuddin Tajiran-E-Kutub, Lahore. The current edition of this book with Rekhta is made available by Jamia Hamdard in Delhi. The information surfaced as the annual three-day festival of the Urdu-promoting organisation – Jashn-E-Rekhta – is going on from 8th December to 10th December at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. Besides Mushaira and other talks in the Jashn-E-Rekhta program, the Rekhta Foundation also has various counters for selling books and other merchandise where many Urdu books are for sale. As the biography of Ilmuddin is listed on Rekhta’s website, it becomes necessary to understand what kind of Urdu literature it is promoting, who was Ilmuddin and what he had done.Ilmuddin killed author and publisher Mahashay Rajpal on 6th April 1929 in Lahore. Ilmuddin – a carpenter – was 19 years old at that time. stabbed Mahashay Rajpal in his chest eight times while he was seated on the outer verandah of his shop. Mahashay Rajpal did not survive the attack. The reason for this murder was alleged blasphemy. It was no different than what we see as death threats and beheading threats like ‘Sar Tan Se Juda’ for alleged blasphemy or alleged insult of the Islamic prophet in contemporary times.Mahashay Rajpal published a book named Rangeela Rasool. He was killed for publishing this so-called satire on Prophet Muhammad. Mahashay Rajpal’s book came in response to two provoking books by Muslims.In fact, in 1923, Muslims published two books. One was named ‘Krishna, your Gita will have to be burnt’. In this, Muslims made indecent and obscene comments about Lord Krishna. The other book was ‘The Maharshi of the Nineteenth Century’. The book contained derogatory remarks on Swami Dayanand Saraswati, the founder of Arya Samaj. In response to these books written by Islamic fundamentalists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, who was a good friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a satire on Prophet Muhammad and asked Rajpal never to reveal the author of this book i.e. his name to anyone. Maybe he knew the consequences. The book was published without any name.Muslims were enraged by this book. MK Gandhi also wrote in his ‘Young India’ that this is a divisive book ignoring how Muslims first provoked Hindus. In 1924, the British banned the book. Several cases were registered against the book under Section 153 A of the IPC. In 1927, Mahashay Rajpal was let off by evidence that what was written in the book was based on facts, so it cannot be said that it increased hatred between the two groups.When the court pronounced the verdict regarding this book, the Muslims were even more enraged and shaken. They started rioting and there was a demand to behead Mahashay Rajpal. The slogans described how the killing of Mahashay Rajpal is allowed in Islamic Sharia. After receiving death threats for years and surviving two attacks, Mahashay Rajpal was killed by Ilmuddin in 1929.Mahashay Rajpal’s killer was represented in court by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who argued for his innocence. Ilmuddin was executed by hanging in Central Jail Mianwali on 31st October 1929. At his funeral, the poet Mohammad Iqbal, a favourite of Indian liberals today, eulogized the killer. Today his grave is a religious site in Pakistan and Pakistani textbooks eulogize him with the title of “Ghazi”. Many books are written on his ‘life’ and his ‘work’. His two biopics were made in Pakistan – one in 1978 and the other in 2002. After the partition, Mahashay Rajpal’s family moved to Delhi from where “Rajpal and Sons” continues to operate today. Almost 70 years after his death, he was awarded the first “International Freedom to Publish Award” by then deputy PM LK Advani.As Ilmuddin has become a ‘Ghazi’ for Islamists, many people have written his biographies. One such biography is reproduced in the form of an eBook with contributions from Jamia Hamdard. It is promoted by the Rekhta Foundation of Sanjiv Saraf. There are many sponsors to the event the Jashn-E-Rekhta. Questions are also asked on social media about what exactly they are supporting.X user ‘The Skin Doctor’ posted, “Rekhta is a non-profit org promoting Urdu literature & culture. Its flagship event ‘Jashn-e-Rekhta’ is a huge commercial success as evidenced by its list of sponsors. But in the guise of promoting Urdu, Rekhta is promoting extremist literature as well. “Umri Ghazi Ilmuddin Shaheed”. Ilmuddin was an extremist who killed Mahashe Rajpal in 1929 for alleged blasphemy after years of STSJ calls on the victim. I hope these sponsors know what they are supporting.”Rekhta is a non-profit org apparently promoting Urdu literature & culture.Its flagship event 'Jashn-e-Rekhta' is a huge commerical success as evident by its list of sponsors (image 2).But in the guise of promoting Urdu, Rekhta is promoting extremist literature as well (image… pic.twitter.com/6Pe4cnVceBShockingly, the book hailing a murderer is being promoted and marketed at a time when killings in the name of ‘blasphemy’ against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad have dramatically increased. In 2019, two Islamists dressed as Hindus entered the Lucknow residence of Hindu Samaj leader Kamlesh Tiwari and murdered him in broad daylight for his remarks on Prophet Muhammad made in 2015. In 2022, a young man named Kishan Bharwad was at the receiving end of Islamist wrath when fundamentalists shot him dead for simply sharing a video on Prophet Muhammad that Muslims found offensive. Later in the same year, former BJP functionary Nupur Sharma faced death threats and Sar Tan Se Juda threats issued against her after Alt News cofounder Mohammed Zubair dog-whistled Islamists with a cropped video of Sharma responding to insults hurled at Hindu Gods. Kanhaiya Lal, a tailor from Udaipur, was beheaded by two Islamists for extending solidarity with beleaguered former BJP leader Nupur Sharma as Islamists across the country bayed for her blood.

The general secretary of the Sri Ram Janmbhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai released splendid images of the temple’s sanctuary sanctorum on 9th December ahead of the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22nd January 2023 between noon and 12:45 pm.He stated, “The sanctum sanctorum of Lord Shri Ramlala is almost ready.

The three idols are currently getting finishing touches discreetly away from public view. One is being meticulously sculpted from the white marble of Makrana, Rajasthan, while the other two are taking form from stones sourced in Karnataka. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable to make the idol.Champat Rai previously stated that the idols are receiving final touches and are currently 90% completed. “At Ram Janambhoomi temple, a 4 feet 3-inch idol depicting the 5-year-old child form of Lord Ram is being constructed at three locations in Ayodhya. Three artisans are building the idol on three different pieces of stone, and one of the idols will be accepted by the Lord. These idols are 90 per cent ready, and the finishing work will take about a week to be done. The idol will be installed in the ‘Grabhgriha’ (sanctum-sanctorum) on the ground floor. The ground floor of the temple is almost ready. So, there will be no problem with ‘Praan-Pratishtha’ (consecration ceremony).”In its meeting slated for this month, the Trust will choose the most captivating and resilient among the three idols to be installed in the sanctum-sanctorum of the Ram Mandir. The remaining two idols will also find their places within the temple, albeit in different locations. The idol depicts the diety’s child form. As per Champat Rai, the general secretary of the temple trust, the decision to choose a 51-inch idol from the three was made by all 15 members of the trust during a meeting chaired by trust chief Mahant Nritya Gopal Das on October 7-8.An 86-year-old Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit Vedic scholar is scheduled to take the helm over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He is descended from the renowned Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who oversaw the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj approximately 350 years ago in 1674.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to be present at the opening of the Ram temple. Furthermore, notable individuals like industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli and Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors are invited to the consecration ceremony. Invites for over 7,000 people comprising 3,000 VIPs have been sent out by the Ram Mandir Trust. The relatives of the Karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement also received an invitation. Four thousand more are requested to attend the sacred event including writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and well-known people from around the country.According to the Sri Ram Janambhoomi Trust, arrangements are made for 10,000 to 15,000 people. Local officials are putting more security in place, coordinating logistics for every guest and preparing for the expected spike in traffic around the holy occasion.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ",BSP suspends Danish Ali from the party over “anti-party” activities,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/danish-ali-suspended-from-bsp-over-anti-party-activities/,"Apparently, Danish Ali was suspended from the BSP as he was supporting the Congress in Parliament. The Congress had also backed Ali on the challenges he was facing, prompting repeated threats from Mayawati's party.On Saturday, December 9, the Bahujan Samaj Party suspended its MP Danish Ali for indulging in “anti-party” activities. The BSP claimed in a statement that Danish Ali had previously been warned about engaging in “anti-party” activities.In a letter signed by Bahujan Samaj Party’s National General Secretary Satish Chandra Mishra to Danish Ali, the party said, “It was made clear to you earlier itself to not indulge in anti-party activities… It is also mandatory to make it clear to you… you were working with the Janata Dal (Secular) under Deve Gowda in Karnataka in 2018… at that time the BSP and Deve Gowda’s Janata Party were contesting the polls together and you were given a ticket from Amroha under the conditions that you would work for the party. Deve Gowda had even said that you would be contesting from the Amroha Lok Sabha seat on the grounds that you will be working for the BSP. However, despite winning from Amroha, you have forgotten all the promises and assurances you made and engaged in anti-party activities. Thus, the party has decided to suspend you with immediate effect.”Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) suspends its MP Danish Ali for indulging in anti-party activities: BSP pic.twitter.com/BKHHuVbStwApparently, Danish Ali was suspended from the BSP as he was supporting the Congress in Parliament. The Congress had also backed Ali on the challenges he was facing, prompting repeated threats from Mayawati’s party.In the 2017 Karnataka Assembly elections, Ali played a significant role in the formation of a post-poll coalition between the JD(S) and Congress. Back then, was designated convenor of the five-member Coalition Coordination and Monitoring Committee set up by the two parties while they formed a short-lived JD(S)-Congress government.Danish Ali ran for Lok Sabha in 2019 on a BSP ticket from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, not far from his hometown of Hapur. Despite his maiden political contest and the BJP’s overwhelming victory in the state owing to a Muslim-dominated constituency with a sizable Dalit population. He received around 51% of the vote, defeating sitting BJP MP Kunwar Singh Tanwar by a margin of over 63,000 votes.आप अचानक आ गये, मेरा हौसला बढ़ा गये! नफ़रत हारेगी, मुहब्बत जीतेगी!!!Your surprise visit gave me immense strength to continue my fight against growing hate culture in the country!Thank you Rahul ji!🙏🙏🙏 https://t.co/2UeonxBGoTDanish Ali gained support from Congress MP Rahul Gandhi during the issue over BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri’s use of disparaging comments towards Ali in parliament.

"9 December, 2023 ",“It was to tell the audience that an animal is coming”: Actress Mansi Taxak justifies marital rape scene in film Animal,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/actress-mansi-taxak-justifies-marital-rape-scene-in-film-animal/,"Film 'Animal', directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, and Triptii Dimri, among others, was released on December 1. The film ‘Animal’ starring Ranbir Kapoor, Boby Deol, and Anil Kapoor in lead roles has created a storm at the box office. The film has received appreciation for the performances of the lead actors and is breaking all box office records. However, the Sandeep Reddy Vanga directorial has also received criticism over the ‘glorification’ of violence, toxicity and misogyny. In a recent interview with Zoom Entertainment, actress Mansi Taxak, who plays one of the wives of actor Bobby Deol’s character Abrar, defended the marital rape scene saying that it was to depict the character’s animal instincts.During the interview, Mansi was asked specifically about the wedding scene in Animal, in which Abrar learns of his brother’s death. He begins by killing the messenger before viciously assaulting Mansi’s character, the youngest of his three wives. Following that, he gestures for his other two wives to join them in the bedroom and continues to abuse them also. “It is shocking, of course. Nobody expects their wedding to end that way. When the wedding sequence starts, if you see the lights and the way the art was done, it was beautiful. You hear the music, that has gone so viral on Instagram. It was heading towards a beautiful end, and suddenly, you see something like this happening,” Mansi said.“It was to tell the audience that an animal is coming, if you thought Ranbir was this way, you can expect the villain to be (worse). It was an apt way to establish Bobby Sir’s character and to show the audience what real animal we’re talking about. I would not wish that to happen at my wedding ever”, the actress continued.Mansi Taxak further lauded Bobby Deol’s performance saying that he was ‘commendable’ in the scene. When asked about the backlash over the film’s portrayal of women, Mansi said that her character was in love with Abrar. The actress denied that any assault transpired in the scene.“If you see the scene before that, the wedding scene, if you see the sort of chemistry that we have, the eye contact that we have… It tells you the back story, that besides their differences, their age, and their careers, they do love each other, and that’s why they’re getting married. I completely get where people are coming from, but that was not the intent. It was not the intent to show that any sort of assault was happening. It was just that Bobby sir did not expect his brother’s death news to come at the wedding, which puts the character into a zone where he couldn’t think straight. And that’s what we’re talking about, right? Animal instincts are unpredictable instincts. So he goes into that zone, and to vent out his emotions, he comes to his wives. I don’t think it was intended to be any sort of assault. I didn’t feel it on the set, or in the script. That was not the case. It was just a relationship between two people that has panned out the way it did,” Mansi Taxak said.Interestingly, right after defending the marital rape scene and denying any assault, Mansi Taxak asserted that cinema is a reflection of society. “You know… cinema is a reflection of society, so when you see these kinds of scenes onscreen, it is actually happening in the society and there are people who are doing these things to their spouses…their wives….”#Animal is SENSATIONAL… Packs an EXTRAORDINARY TOTAL in Week 1…⭐️ Third biggest *7 days* of all time.⭐️ Biggest *7-day* total for a film released on non-holiday.⭐️ Biggest *7-day* total for a film that faced a clash with another film.⭐️ Highest grossing ‘A’ certified film.… pic.twitter.com/4YcQiC2NcHFilm ‘Animal’, directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga and starring Ranbir Kapoor, Rashmika Mandanna, Bobby Deol, Anil Kapoor, and Triptii Dimri, among others, was released on December 1.

"10 December, 2023 ","Mahua Moitra was Vice President at JP Morgan, but that post doesn’t mean what one may imagine. Here is the truth about fancy designations...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohua-moitra-was-vice-president-at-jp-morgan-that-does-not-mean-she-was-in-very-senior-position/,"A vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. On 8th December (Friday), the Lok Sabha voted in favour of expelling the Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra on the recommendation of the Ethics Committee against the TMC leader in connection with the cash-for-query scam case. Since her ouster, several netizens have flaunted her past credentials as the Vice President at the Investment Banking giant JP Morgan and Chase. Notably, it is touted among the big five in the Investment banking sector. Supporting the accused TMC leader, some social media users claimed that she is innocent of the cash-for-query scam case and alleged that it is an attempt to silence her. They argued that Moitra left her lucrative and ‘distinguished’ position at one of the biggest investment banks (I-bank) to enter politics and serve the people of her constituency.इस खूबसूरत तस्वीर को गौर से देखिये….इसे देखकर पता लगता है क्या कि इस महिला ने करोड़ो रु की बैंक की नौकरी एक झटके में समाज सेवा के लिए छोड़ दी थी…इस तस्वीर से यह भी नही लगता कि इस महिला की एक स्पीच से पूरी बीजेपी के फासीवाद को नंगा कर दिया था ये तस्वीर यह भी नही बताती यह… pic.twitter.com/dojLHNKUusAdditionally, they asserted that her lavish lifestyle is a result of her previous role as the VP at JP Morgan, a high-paying and consequential post. Furthermore, they claimed that her ‘senior’ position in the top Investment Bank underscores her leadership qualities, which have rattled her naysayers insinuating that she has a brain of her own and didn’t need to take cues from others to shape her decisions countering the allegations that she accepted bribery to ask pliable questions. However, several netizens have pointed out that the senior-most designation in the I-banks is not a rarity linked with high calibre and exemplary growth. Instead, it is a general trend in Investment Banks to dole out fancy designations to scores of employees, sometimes even in the hundreds to thousands. This is done for various reasons, including massaging the egos of their employees, non-cash retention tools to assuage lower paychecks, or creating an impression on clients/customers, among other considerations.Some fools are under the impression that Mahua Moitra once being ""vice president"" at some bank is a huge dealAt big investment banks, almost everyone is a ""vice president""Goldman-Sachs for example reportedly has almost 12,000 ""vice-presidents."" pic.twitter.com/maCl78aqCB""Vice President"" in an investment bank is not what you think it is https://t.co/8jHDYA0QFG pic.twitter.com/Qmik1Yrw4LIt is generally assumed that an official with senior-most designations like Vice-President, Director, or Managing Director would be among the highest-ranking decision-makers in any company or country, possibly holding the 2nd or 3rd authority in the entity. However, things are different in I-Banks, and according to reports, as high as 30-40% or even higher of officials enjoy these fancy titles of VP, Director, or MD without their designations granting them as much power, privilege, or reflection of experience as their contemporary designation holders in non-I-Banks get.In March 2012, Goldman Sachs, in a court case, noted that the plaintiff Greg Smith, an estranged VP of the firm, was one of 12,000 VPs in their organisation. Back then, US media also estimated that 40% of Goldman staff were VPs as it was estimated to have 2,400 managing directors!While it was a decade-old case, things have not changed much, and recent estimates also highlight that there are between 10,000 and 12,000 Vice Presidents employed at Goldman Sachs, FourWeekMBA reported in October this year.Reuters in November this year reported that Goldman Sachs would promote 608 executives to managing directors next year. These would be fewer than the 643 senior bankers it elevated two years ago, according to a company memo. Notably, the Wall Street firm announces managing director promotions every two years. The number of promotions this year is the lowest since Goldman promoted 465 in 2019, before the pandemic, the report added.Similarly, on 4the July 2022, the global accounting and consulting firm EY became the latest firm to promote thousands of its employees to “partner” without offering them a share of profits, the Financial Times reported. However, outside the non-I-banking terminology, a ‘partner’ is often assumed a co-founder or large shareholder which is not the case in I-banks.   However, this phenomenon isn’t confined to I-banks alone. According to a report from the Small Investor Protection Association, there are approximately 121,000 registered financial professionals in Canada. The majority of them, classified as dealing representatives, are essentially salespeople licensed to sell financial investments. Only about 4,000 among these registered financial professionals bear a fiduciary duty, a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. Meanwhile, the exact figures and percentages of individuals bearing these inflated corporate titles may vary, the prevalence of fancy designations, as exemplified by Goldman Sachs, is a common practice in the sphere of investment banking. This broad trend is observed in I-banks worldwide, including those in India. This means that I-banks are plentiful of Vice-presidents, directors, and managing directors.A consultant from a financial services company, Jerome Tillier, conducted a test and discovered a significant number of hits when searching for the keyword ‘bank vice-president’ in LinkedIn’s search box. He pointed out that this number is larger than the population of Malta. Similarly, when searching for the keyword ‘Vice President JP Morgan Chase’ in India, the results yield thousands of hits, featuring dozens of Vice Presidents, Managing Directors, and other senior positions available regularly.Furthermore, in a wrongful termination lawsuit between Bank of America and an Indian-American, Padmanabhan Ramanathan, at the California Court of Appeals in 2007, the bank’s legal representation made an unusual assertion. As detailed by the California Business Litigation Blog, the counsel contended that the bank has the authority to label any employee, “including janitors, maintenance workers, everyone,” as “vice-presidents” if it so chooses. The assertion that a bank can make even a janitor as VP aptly explains why an Investment bank VP or MD doesn’t immediately translate to authority, experience, and command in that domain or career growth viz-a-viz equivalent title holder employed in non-I-banks. It is important to note that the abundance of such posts has diminished the perceived authority associated with these positions. Evidently, a vice president is the most junior of the senior bankers and, as far as clients and higher-ups are concerned, the post carries the first legitimate title. The general Hierarchical structure in an Investment bank could include Analysts followed by Associates, then VP, Senior VP, and Managing Directors. This begs the question: What accounts for the abundance of these fancy titles in certain fields like Investment banking?Foremost, Indian and India-based banks adopted a well-established practice observed in American banks, particularly investment banks (I-banks). Evidently, post-liberalisation, American banks introduced their HR norms to India, and the influence of peer pressure compelled Indian private banks and I-banks to conform to these practices.A major reason for these inflated Corporate titles is to stoke egos. A bank executive said, “Fancy designations address a human need for validation by employers.”The head of one of the largest MNC I-banks in India noted, “The MD designation gives social status…being an MD symbolises seniority outside.”Another reason for so many VPs, MDs, and Directors is to make an impression on customers.K Sudarshan is a managing partner, Asia at EMA Partners International which is a global executive search firm.Explaining the rationale and power wielded by such fancy titles, Sudarshan said, “Designations like MD, VP are not jobs, but grades that reflect seniority. VPs are just fancy titles on visiting cards for market-facing executives… VPs are ubiquitous and the title does not mean anything and has nothing to do with the job one is doing…even the person managing in-house tech support can be called MD, technology.”VP & Head – HR, India Factoring and Finance Solutions, Gauri Das explains that companies try to go innovative with designation, wherever required, and use it as a “retention tool”.According to Das, another reason for fancy designation is to compensate for low payouts by giving a very high social status through designations. This is because afancy and inflated title does not cost money and is not necessarily linked with the paycheck, making it an easy tool for employee happiness.As per experts, one of the reasons can also be to create a buzz on social media. Das added, “Fancy designations help you get many eyeballs.” Job titles like Customer Service Evangelist, Marketing Dynamo, Head of First Impressions (Receptionist), Opportunity Creator (Business Development), and Master of Disaster (the one who helps federal agencies with information to manage calamities) among others are an example of it.In a sector where customer perception is crucial, a headhunter said, “A customer meeting a vice-president is going to be a bit impressed…and a company looking for an acquisition likes the idea of liaising with an MD.”He added, “These designations are visiting card tools for banks to present a grand face to people and companies.”Meanwhile, after her education, Mahua Moitra worked as an investment banker for Investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase in New York and London. In 2009, she quit her position as one of the vice presidents of JPMorgan Chase in London to join politics, where there were thousands of VPs in the bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Several such criminal cases have occurred in the state recently.In the first incident, a 14-year-old student in 9th grade named Arun Yadav son of Bhupendra Yadav was shot dead in Jhalar village of Bandhua Kurawa police station area located in Bounsi Block on the evening of 8 December. Meanwhile, 45-year-old Kuldeep Rai who was also wounded in the firing died on the next day morning at Mayaganj Hospital during treatment. Kuldeep Rai’s 7-year-old daughter Shraddha Kumari, Arun Yadav’s 40-year-old mother Tara Devi and their 30-year-old neighbour Indu Devi are receiving care at the referral hospital.The former head of Chilkara Panchayat Pappu Yadav and his associates reportedly committed the crime due to personal enmity. Harku Rai who is the father of Kuldeep Rai has also passed away. Arun Yadav’s uncle (father’s brother) Karthik Yadav informed the police that on the morning of 8th December Pappu Yadav had a dispute with the deceased teenager’s brother and his nephew Pankaj Yadav over parking a vehicle on the road.The accused then arrived in the evening accompanied by his brothers Himanshu and Amar, uncles (father’s brothers) Samudra Yadav and Kuldeep Yadav and driver Doma Yadav. They began to fire in retaliation after which Arun Yadav was shot in the chest and died on the spot and injured others.According to the relatives, six or seven rounds were fired. Police reached the village in large numbers after they received information about the occurrence. However, all the perpetrators escaped from the village till then but cops eventually apprehended one person. There is also a rifle and pistol license in the name of Pappu Yadav. His father Prayag Yadav was also killed a decade ago in a battle for supremacy. He then obtained a weapon license. Superintendent of Police Dr Satya Prakash stated that the rivalry between the two sides was the reason behind the crime and one individual is in their custody. Bandhua Kurawa police station in-charge Mantu Kumar revealed that the police are interrogating the arrested person. The boy’s dead body has been sent for post-mortem and the family members have not registered a case yet. However, the cops are conducting raids to nab the other offenders.A team under the jurisdiction of Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Vipin Bihari, Bounsi police station Inspector America Ram, Bounsi police station in-charge Arvind Kumar Rai and Bandhua Kurawa police station in-charge Mantu Kumar has been created and is currently executing searches regularly.In another instance, around 3 am on 9th December, two youths arrived in a car and asked engineer Vipin Kumar who is from Uttar Pradesh’s Mirzapur to halt the excavation of the road which resulted in an argument between the two parties when one of the two people took out a pistol and opened fire at the the latter. He was urgently admitted to an emergency hospital in Safiabad for treatment. It is alleged that he was shot in the knee.According to the information, construction work is going on under Namami Gange Yojana in the Munger Municipal Corporation area. A sewage treatment plant is under construction in the city in which the road is being excavated. The victim has been transported to a private nursing home for medical care. The Qasim Bazar police station in-charge Mintu Singh went to the hospital as soon as he heard about the occurrence and obtained information about the same. Afterwards, the authorities raided many places to arrest the accused and succeeded in capturing one of them. The police official assured that the inquiry is underway and the captured offender is being questioned.The Nawada district of Bihar witnessed a young man mercilessly stabbed to death by criminals in broad daylight. They repeatedly attacked him with a knife thirty times after throwing chilli powder in his eyes. Rahul Kumar, a 19-year-old who lives in the Nagar police station area on Postmortem Road Shivnagar Mohalla has been confirmed as the victim. He was the only son of Vasudev Prasad and Savitri Devi who is employed at Mandal Kara jail as a Home Guard jawan.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ",You cannot win polls on social media. Can’t understand why opposition does not have confidence in our country: PM Modi at Viksit Bharat event,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/you-cannot-win-polls-on-social-media-pm-modis-dig-at-opposition/,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hit out at the opposition parties over not giving importance to public welfare, saying that they cannot win polls on social media but need to interact with people and win their hearts.“You cannot win polls on social media; you need to go amid people. Before winning polls, you need to win people’s hearts. You should not underestimate them. If some political parties had prioritized service to people instead of thinking about political gains, a majority of our country’s population would not have been facing so many difficulties, deprivation, and problems today,” Prime Minister Modi said while interacting with the beneficiaries of Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra through video conferencing.Hitting out at the opposition for announcing false promises before polls, the Prime Minister said, “I don’t know why our opposition does not have confidence in our country. Some political parties don’t understand that they cannot get anything from false promises.”PM Modi further said that he need not have given guarantees to people if the opposition had worked diligently.“If they had worked diligently for decades, the guarantees which Modi is giving today would have been fulfilled 50 years ago,” he said.In a veiled dig at the welfare schemes announced by the UPA government when they were in power, PM Modi said, “Modi’s guarantee implies that a guarantee that the guarantee itself will be fulfilled.”The Prime Minister said that when a beneficiary receives benefit from government schemes their confidence increases and they get a new strength to live their lives.“Crores of families in villages across the country have benefited from some government scheme or the other. When one gets the benefit, one’s confidence increases. They get a new strength to live their lives,” PM Modi said.“The notion of begging for getting benefits under government schemes that existed earlier is now gone. The government identified the beneficiaries and then took steps to extend the benefits to them,” he said.The Prime Minister said that he is happy to note that people in villages are welcoming the ‘Guarantee Wali Gadi’ vehicle with enthusiasm.“I am glad to note that for welcoming the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, our Panchayats have formed the ‘Swagat Samitis’ in villages; all sections of the society including the elderly have joined the Samitis,” PM Modi said.“It is a big achievement that in such a short time, more than 1.25 crore people have reached out to Modi’s guaranteed vehicle and welcomed it,” he added.The programme was joined virtually by thousands of VBSY beneficiaries from across the country. More than two thousand VBSY vans, thousands of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and Common Service Centres (CSCs) from across the country were connected during the programme.Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with a beneficiary of PM Mudra Yojana, Mukesh who received Rs 4.5 lakh through a loan to open a shop. The Prime Minister congratulated him for transforming himself from a job-seeker to a job-maker. He also urged him to conduct most of his business through UPI payments.A large number of Union Ministers, MPs, MLAs and local-level representatives also joined the programme.Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra is being undertaken across the country to attain saturation of flagship schemes of the government by ensuring that the benefits of these schemes reach all targeted beneficiaries in a time-bound manner. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"9 December, 2023 ",‘I am sorry’: Harvard president Claudine Gay apologises for refusing to condemn genocide calls against Jews on campus,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/harvard-president-claudine-gay-apologises-over-calls-for-genocide-against-jews-on-campus/,"In an interview with Harvard Crimson on December 8, Gay said, ""I am sorry. Words matter. When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret.""In the aftermath of global outrage and condemnation, Claudine Gay, the President of Harvard University, has ‘apologised’ for refusing to condemn the calls for the genocide of Jews on the varsity campus.In an interview with Harvard Crimson on December 8, Gay said, “I am sorry. Words matter. When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret.”She further claimed that she failed to convey her “truth” that calls for violence against Jews has no place in Harvard. “I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures. What I should have had the presence of mind to do at that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged. Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” Gay said.Ironically, Gay expressed her pleasure to attend the hearing and answer questions from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce members. She said that hearing was an opportunity to convey the depth of both my personal commitment and the institutional commitment to combating antisemitism.” However, while conveying her ‘commitment to combating antisemitism, Gay ended up contextualising calls for genocide against Jews.Meanwhile, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik slammed Claudine Gay over her ‘apology’ saying that she had asked Gay seventeen times whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates Harvard’s code of conduct, and the world heard her ‘truth’.“No, Dr. Gay. You were given an opportunity to speak your truth. And you did. Not once. Not twice Not 5x. Not 10x I asked you 17x(!!!) in the hearing about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates @Harvard code of conduct. You spoke your truth under oath 17x. And the world heard it,” Stefanik posted on X.No, Dr. Gay. You were given an opportunity to speak your truth. And you did. Not once. Not twiceNot 5x.Not 10xI asked you 17x(!!!) in the hearing about whether calling for the genocide of Jews violates @Harvard code of conduct.You spoke your truth under oath 17x. And…In another X post, Stefanik announced that she along with 72 other Congress representatives have penned a bipartisan letter to the authorities seeking the dismissal of the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).I am proud to lead a bipartisan letter with @RepMoskowitz and 72 of our colleagues to the members of the Governing Boards of @Harvard, @MIT, and @Penn demanding that their presidents be removed after this week's @EdWorkforceCmte hearing.Read the full letter here. pic.twitter.com/IOPpNdNh34“…Given this moment of crisis, we demand that your boards immediately remove each of these presidents from their positions and that you provide an actionable plan to ensure that Jewish and Israeli students, teachers, and faculty are safe on your campuses. Anything less than these steps will be seen as your endorsement of what Presidents Gay, Magill, and Kornbluth said to Congress and an act of complicity in their antisemitic posture. The world is watching – you can stand with your Jewish students and faculty, or you can choose the side of dangerous antisemitism,” the letter reads.In the face of global denunciation over refusing to condemn calls for violence against the Jewish people, the presidents of Harvard and UPenn on December 7 issued ‘clarification‘ backtracking from contextualising the genocide calls. The ‘clarification’ came right after the White House slammed statements of Harvard and UPenn presidents.Meanwhile, truck billboards reading “Fire Liz” were seen in Philadelphia on Thursday seeking the removal of UPenn president Liz Magill after the controversy. Two privately-funded trucks are circling the University of Pennsylvania campus on streets such as Walnut and Spruce, while making pit stops at popular spots for students like the Penn bookstore. The trucks also show photos of the Jewish victims who have been killed or taken hostage by Hamas, Fox News reported.Notably, the controversy erupted on 5th December, during the first hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” in Washington, DC. As reported earlier, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard, MIT, and UPenn during the hearing over the issue of rising cases of antisemitism on their campuses. During the hearing, Harvard University President Claudine Gay, MIT University President Sally Kornbluth, and UPenn President Elizabeth Magill refused to condemn the calls for the genocide of Jews on their respective campuses as bullying and harassment, when asked to offer a simple “yes” or “no” answer on whether advocating for the murder of Jews would violate the University’s bullying and harassment policies.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","India’s per capita emissions ‘very low’, clubbing with emitters like China and the US unacceptable: European Parliament member",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/indias-per-capita-emissions-very-low-clubbing-with-major-emitters-wrong-eu-parliament-member/,"Earlier this week, a global team of scientists released a report highlighting that India’s per capita carbon dioxide emissions were less than half of the global average. On 9th December (Saturday), a senior official of the European Parliament expressed dissatisfaction with concerted attempts against New Delhi over pollution and wrongly clubbing India with major emitters like China, the US, and Gulf nations. Speaking with PTI at the UN climate talks in Dubai, Peter Liese, a German politician and a member of the European Parliament asserted that clubbing India with emitters like China and the US is completely unacceptable as India’s per capita emissions are “very low”.He emphasised, “Indian people should be able to own a car when people in Germany own two cars.” Liese added, “It is very important to acknowledge for everybody that per capita emissions of the UAE, China, and the US… they are very different from India. Many people in Europe put China and India in the same basket and sometimes even with the Gulf states which is completely unacceptable. India has very low per capita emissions compared to these countries.” Notably, India has been facing concerted efforts that attempt to club it with major emitters like the US at climate negotiations despite its low per capita emissions.Earlier this week, a global team of scientists released a report highlighting that India’s per capita carbon dioxide emissions were less than half of the global average even though it rose by around five per cent last year to reach 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The team of scientists pointed out that the United States topped the per capita emissions chart. The report revealed that on average every individual in the US emits 14.9 tonnes of CO₂. This is followed by Russia (11.4), Japan (8.5), China (8), and the European Union (6.2), whereas, the average global per capita emission stood at 4.7 tonnes.The European Union has been planning to impose a border tax on energy-intensive goods from developing countries like India. This enraged a debate at the international climate conference in Dubai as poorer countries firmly argued that this tax would harm livelihoods and economic growth. The aim of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is to set a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of energy-intensive products like iron, steel, cement, fertilizers, and aluminium in countries outside the EU. It is claimed that this will serve two purposes. First, it will create a level playing field for domestically manufactured green goods. Second, it plans to reduce emissions from imports which account for around 20 percent of the bloc’s total emissions. The implementation of the carbon tax is scheduled for 1st January 2026. Throughout the trial period, initiated on 1st October 2023, companies in seven carbon-intensive sectors, including steel, cement, fertilizer, aluminum, and hydrocarbon products, are required to disclose emissions data to the EU.Regarding this controversial CBAM, Liese said meeting the bloc’s climate promises is “just not possible” without it. The EU has committed to achieving a reduction of at least 55 percent in emissions by the year 2030, in comparison to the levels observed in 1990.Liese added, “Despite low per capita emissions, India’s cement, iron, and steel are as carbon-intensive as produced elsewhere in the world. So we need to find a good balance here.” The EU implements stringent regulations on carbon emissions through its ‘Emissions Trading System,’ which places caps on emissions for industries and allows them to purchase ‘allowances’ if they surpass their limits. However, the bloc is concerned that this strict approach could lead some businesses to relocate to countries with more lenient rules, a phenomenon known as carbon leakage. According to a recent study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2021), the introduction of CBAM and a USD 44 per tonne carbon tax would reduce leakage by over half, from 13.3 percent to 5.2 percent.Further, a New Delhi-based public policy think tank Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) conducted a study regarding the impact of this border taxation (CBAM) on India’s exporters. According to their study, Indian exporters of steel and aluminium could lose up to USD 2 billion due to border taxation in European countries. It is important to note that India was the eighth-largest exporter of iron and steel to the EU in 2019. It is believed although carbon taxes could encourage producers to lower emissions, it may divert the focus of resource-deficient nations from adapting to climate impacts to prioritizing emission reduction.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","Used to work 85-90 hours in a week, from 6:20 AM to 8:30 PM, 6 days a week: Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/worked-85-90-hours-week-infosys-co-founder-narayana-murthy/,"Narayana Murthy added,""My parents taught me very early in life that the only way we could hope to escape poverty was to work very, very hard - of course, assuming that one gets the best productivity from each hour of work.""NR Narayana Murthy, the co-founder of Infosys, has stated that he put in long hours when he started his compan. Mr Murthy’s comment comes months after he proposed that young people in India should work for at least 70 hours a week to increase productivity. His statement led to a major row at the time. He revealed that he worked more than 85 to 90 hours a week up till 1994 in an interview with The Economic Times.The 77-year-old businessman said, “I used to be in the office at 6:20 AM and leave office at 8:30 PM, and worked six days a week. I know every nation that became prosperous did so through hard work.” Narayana Murthy added,”My parents taught me very early in life that the only way we could hope to escape poverty was to work very, very hard – of course, assuming that one gets the best productivity from each hour of work.”Mr Murthy’s father was a Mysore schoolteacher and he was the fifth of eight children in a modestly-off family. Afterwards, he studied computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kanpur after earning a degree in electrical engineering from Mysore University. “During my entire 40-plus years of professional life, I worked 70 hours a week,” he reiterated, “When we had a six-day week – till 1994 – I used to work at least 85 to 90 hours a week. That has not been a waste.”The country’s work productivity is among the lowest in the world, according to the billionaire who made this claim on a recent podcast with former Infosys board member and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Mohandas Pai.Narayana Murthy stressed that India has significant ground to cover while talking to The Economic Times. “We must remember that with a per-capita (income) of $2,300, India is a poor country. For us to become a middle-income country (with a per-capita of $8,000-10,000) it will take about 16 to 18 years even with an annual growth rate of 8%.”He noted that it takes this kind of dedication to break free from the cycle of poverty. “My parents told me that the only way I could escape from the orbit of poverty was by good values – honesty, hard work, discipline and good work ethic. Putting the interest of the community ahead of one’s interest in the short and medium term will lead to personal betterment. I know every nation that became prosperous did so through hard work”, Mr Murthy added.In October, NR Narayana Murthy made news when he remarked in the “The Record” podcast of 3one4 Capital that young people needed to work seventy hours a week in order to boost the country’s overall productivity. Prominent figures from a variety of businesses responded differently to his comment. While some shared his opinions, others believed that producing the best outcomes required quality effort rather than quantity.Last month, in a candid conversation with Zerodha’s Nikhil Kamath at the 26th edition of Bengaluru Tech Summit, Narayana Murthy voiced his disapproval of freebies and asserted that “nothing should be given for free.” He also opined that compassionate capitalism can help a ‘poor’ country like India to become developed. Mr Murthy highlighted, “When you provide those services, when you provide those subsidies, there must be something in return that they’re willing to do. For example, if you say I will give you free electricity, then it would have been a very nice thing for the government to have said, but we want to see the percentage attendance in primary schools and middle schools go up by 20 per cent, then only we will give you that.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Yogi Balaknath said that he needs to gain experience under the guidance of Narendra Modi.Yogi Balaknath posted, “Under the leadership of the party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, I got the opportunity from the people to serve the nation by becoming an MP first and now an MLA. Ignore the discussions going on in the media and social media after the election results came out. I am yet to gain experience under the guidance of the Prime Minister.”पार्टी व प्रधानमंत्री @narendramodi जी के नेतृत्व में जनता-जनार्धन ने पहली बार सांसद व विधायक बना कर राष्ट्रसेवा का अवसर दिया।चुनाव परिणाम आने के बाद से मीडिया व सोशल मीडिया पर चल रही चर्चाओं को नज़र अंदाज़ करें।मुझे अभी प्रधानमंत्री जी के मार्गदर्शन में अनुभव प्राप्त करना है।Notably, on 6th December, a purported press release attributed to BJP claimed that the party had selected Mahanth Balaknath Yogi as the next Chief Minister and appointed two Deputy Chief Ministers to assist the CM.It also stated that Senior BJP leader and MLA from Sawai Madhopur, Kirodi Lal Meena, and MLA from Rajsamand Diya Kumari, will be the two Deputy Chief Ministers.

Political analysts are offering varied interpretations of Balaknath’s post. Some argue that the Yogi might be signalling his withdrawal from the race for the Chief Ministerial position, while others contend that the definitive decision on the CM candidate will only emerge after the legislative party meeting.On Friday, Yogi Balaknath held discussions with senior leaders in Delhi, and it is speculated that he may have received indications suggesting that his chances of becoming the Chief Minister are slim. This could potentially explain the nature of the X post by the chief priest of the Rohtak Shrine of the Nath sect.Names discussed in the Chief Ministerial race include Union Ministers Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Om Mathur, Diya Kumari, Kirori Lal Meena, and former CM Vasundhara Raje. The legislative party is scheduled to convene in Jaipur on December 10, and a comprehensive understanding of the situation is anticipated only after the conclusion of this meeting.Mahant Balaknath, a spiritual leader and Alwar MP, defeated Congress candidate Imran Khan in the Tijara assembly constituency by a margin of 6,173 votes. he belongs to the Yaduvanshi community and is Chancellor of the Baba Mastnath University (BMU).

"9 December, 2023 ",Samuel Paty beheading: Six teenagers convicted in the killing of French teacher over ‘blasphemy’ against Prophet Muhammad,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/samuel-paty-beheading-six-teens-convicted-in-killing-over-blasphemy-against-prophet-muhammad/,"One of the convicts was a teenage girl who the court found had cooked up a story that led to her teacher being decapitated by a teenage Jihadi terrorist. Five others were convicted for identifying Mr Paty to the attacker, who went on to stab the French teacher in the name of 'blasphemy'.On Friday, a French court found six teenagers guilty in connection with the ‘blasphemy’ killing of teacher Samuel Paty in 2020, a gruesome murder that sent shockwaves throughout the nation and the globe and prompted a reckoning of the looming threat of creeping Islamic extremism.The educator had presented caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad to his students during a lesson on freedom of expression, sparking discontent among certain Muslim parents. The discontent translated into online backlash, with the teacher targeted by Islamic fundamentalists who issued threats against him for what they considered an ‘unpardonable sin’ against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad as many Muslims refrain from portraying prophets, viewing such depictions as blasphemous.One of the convicts was a teenage girl who the court found had cooked up a story that led to her teacher being decapitated by a teenage Jihadi terrorist. Five others were convicted for identifying Mr Paty to the attacker, who went on to stab the French teacher in the name of ‘blasphemy’.Like many school truants, the 13-year-old girl was determined not to let her father know that she had been suspended from school for missing classes. As a result, she weaved a story featuring her teacher Samuel Paty. The girl told her father that Mr Paty had asked Muslim students to leave the classroom while he showed the cartoons from the satirical newspaper Charlier Hebdo during a lesson on free speech and blasphemy.Soon after the girl narrated the fictitious tale, her father took to social media to launch a campaign, identifying Mr Paty and the school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. He also called Mr Paty a “thug” and demanded he be sacked. The claims made by the girl’s father triggered global outrage and led to death threats against Mr Paty. 10 days later, the teacher was dead—decapitated by an Islamist terrorist.It was later reported that the girl’s father was in touch with Paty’s killer, Abdoullakh Anzorov. The prosecutor even claimed that there was a “direct causal link” between the online campaign and Mr Paty’s brutal murder. The murderer had reportedly also a sent text message to the girl’s father before he beheaded Mr Paty with a kitchen knife.The other five defendants were guilty of staking out Mr Paty and identifying him to the killer, Abdoullakh Anzorov, though the court said they were not aware of his intentions to kill Mr Paty. All sentences from 14 months to two years have been suspended or commuted.Samuel Paty was beheaded in October 2020 by an Islamic terrorist in the French capital Paris for allegedly showing caricatures of the Prophet of Islam to his students. A Muslim youth stabbed a 47-year-old teacher in his throat while shouting “Allahu Akbar”. The attacks occurred in the suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine, northwest of Paris on Friday. Abdoullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old Muslim youth, was a native of Chechnya, Russia. Shockingly, the attacker had also taken to social media to post images of the victim’s severed head, which was later removed by the authorities. Friday’s attack comes amidst the ongoing trial against the terrorists responsible for the January 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo. In January 2015, Islamist terrorists had gunned down 12 people in and around the Charlie Hebdo offices for publishing caricatures of Prophet Muhammad.Charlie Hebdo, a satirical newspaper, had published cartoons that depicted Muhammad, which is strictly prohibited in Islam. Offended by Charlie Hebdo’s actions, two Islamic terrorists attacked the office of Hebdo in 2015 and killed 12 people. The terrorists had stated that the attack was an act of revenge for depicting the Prophet Muhammad.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","Accused in Gauri Lankesh case, languishing in jail for 5 years, gets bail: Here are the details of the order and what Karnataka HC...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gauri-lankesh-murder-case-accused-gets-bail-karnataka-high-court-order-explained/,"Mohan Nayak was arrested on 18th July 2018 and his bail application has been rejected on 5 different occasions.On Thursday (7th December), the Karnataka High Court granted bail [pdf] to one Mohan Nayak, who has been in custody for 5 years in connection to the Gauri Lankesh murder case.It must be mentioned that Gauri Lankesh, a controversial ‘journalist’, was killed at her Bengaluru residence by assailants on 5th September 2017. Soon after, the Karnataka police launched a probe into the case. Mohan Nayak was arrested on 18th July 2018 and thereafter booked under the stringent Karnataka Control of Organized Crimes Act (COCA). He has been languishing in jail ever since and his bail application has been rejected on 5 different occasions.Although there are 527 witnesses mentioned in the case chargesheet, only 90 of them have been examined since 2021. Mohan Nayak is accused by the police of ‘conspiring’ to murder Gauri Lankesh, attending meetings to that effect and harbouring assailants in a rented house.A total of 23 witnesses have given testimonies about Nayak renting a room in Kumbalagodu town on the outskirts of Bengaluru in August 2017 with two other accused. Out of them, only 1 has been examined before the trial court to date.It must be noted that the Karnataka High Court in 2019 rejected the bail application of Mohan Nayak and asked the trial court to expedite the trial in the Gauri Lankesh murder case. Due to a delay in trial, Nayak suffered 5 years of incarceration.On Thursday (7th December), a single-judge bench of Justice S Vishwajith Shetty of the Karnataka High Court noted –“Though charges were framed in the present case on 30.10.2021, for the last more than two years, only 90 witnesses have been examined. There are more than 400 charge sheet witnesses who are yet to be examined in the case. Even if it is assumed that all the witnesses who are cited in the charge sheet may not be examined in the case, considering the fact that only 90 witnesses have been nexamined for the last more than two years, it can be safely presumed that any time soon, the trial of the case may not be completed.“The court pointed out that the evidence on record does not show that Mohan Nayak is in a member of organised crime. as claimed by the prosecution.“Though he is alleged to be a member of the syndicate committing organized crime, the material on record would go to show that he is not arrayed as co-accused in any of the cases registered against the other accused persons for committing organized crimes.“The Karnataka High Court noted that Nayak did not offer financial assistance to the other accused. It added that no witness testified about him being a part of a meeting that planned on killing Gauri Lankesh.“From a perusal of the statements recorded under Section 161 Cr.PC of the 23 charge sheet witnesses who have spoken about the role of the petitioner in thepresent case, it is seen that none of these witnesses have stated that the petitioner was a part of the meeting of the accused persons, wherein the accused had conspired to murder Gouri Lankesh. Most of the aforesaid charge sheet witnesses have only spoken about the petitioner taking a house on rent at Kumbalagodu in the outskirts of Bengaluru.“While taking into consideration previous Supreme Court judgments, undue delay in trial, and custody of 5 years, Justice S Vishwajith Shetty granted bail to Mohan Nayak.However, the court imposed five conditions on the undertrial, which include furnishing personal bond of ₹1 lakh, regular appearance in trial court hearings, restriction on travel beyond trial court jurisdiction, non-repetition of similar offences and avoidance of witness tampering.

This observation was made during the acquittal of a husband accused of committing an ‘unnatural offence’ against his wife.In its ruling, Justice Ram Manohar Narayan Mishra’s bench also highlighted that in the anticipated Bhartiya Nyay Sanhita, intended to replace the Indian Penal Code, there is no equivalent provision to Section 377 IPC.'Marital Rape No Offence If Wife Is 18 Or Above': Allahabad HC Endorses MP HC's View That Husband Not Liable U/S 377 IPC For Unnatural Sex | @ISparshUpadhyay#MaritalRape #AllahabadHighCourt #MadhyaPradeshHighCourt #UnnaturalSex #Section377IPChttps://t.co/YxInv1N6HKThe High Court further observed that given the ongoing petitions seeking the criminalisation of marital rape are awaiting consideration by the Supreme Court, there is currently no legal sanction for marital rape if the wife is 18 years of age or older, pending a decision from the highest court.In the current case, the complainant had alleged that her marriage was nothing but an abusive relationship. She accused her husband of verbal and physical abuse and coercion, including acts of sodomy. The husband was convicted under sections 323, 498-A, and 377 of the IPC in the lower court. However, when the case went to the High Court, he was acquitted of the charge under section 377 of the IPC. The court found the accused individual guilty under sections of cruelty by the husband or relatives of the husband (498-A) and voluntarily causing hurt (IPC 323) while absolving him of the charges under Section 377. The court noted that the medical evidence in the case was not supportive of allegations of commission of unnatural sex.Earlier, the Supreme Court consented to consider pleas advocating the criminalisation of marital rape. The central government had conveyed to the apex court that such criminalisation could lead to “social ramifications.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"9 December, 2023 ","“Ho gayi galti ab kya mar jaaun”: Aftab Poonwala, who chopped his live-in partner Shraddha Walkar’s body into 35 pieces, says- Report",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/court-lockup-room-officials-aftab-poonwala-remorse-killing-shraddha-walkar/,"The lockup room officials said that since the first day to this date Aftab has never expressed any regret over his horrific crime. They said that Aftab's body language has remained the same since day one, he even believes that he would be acquittedAftab Amin Poonawala, the man accused of killing and chopping off his live-in partner Shraddha Walkar’s body into 35 pieces is now spending his days in Tihar Jail reading the 6629-page long chargesheet filed against him.It is worth recalling that accused Aftab killed Shraddha in May 2022, six months before his arrest. He allegedly killed her and chopped her body into 35 small pieces. He then bought a new fridge and stored her chopped body parts for days. Over the next few weeks, he disposed of Shraddha’s body in different locations across Delhi. Aftab chopped her body into pieces, he also allegedly ground her bones into powder to scatter on the road.Aftab, however, has never shown a sign of regret or remorse for murdering his live-in partner mercilessly. According to a Dainik Bhaskar report, Aftab remains quiet most of the time in cell number 15 of jail number 4 in Tihar Jail, reading his chargesheet. He often demands bottled water in jail.Dainik Bhaskar reported that on December 5, Aftab was produced before the court of Additional Sessions Judge Manisha Khurana Kakkar. The court was to record the testimonies of three witnesses, including the doctor who conducted the postmortem of Shraddha Walkar’s body parts recovered during the police investigation. It is said that Aftab has lost nearly 15 kgs since he was lodged in jail. An official at Saket Court’s lockup room told Bhaskar that Aftab fears that someone would mix poison in his food and due to this fear he does not even eat food provided in the court, he brings his own packet of biscuits. The official said that Aftab often asks for packaged drinking water and new clothes in jail. However, none of his demands is fulfilled and is provided with the same items as provided to other prisoners.When asked about why Aftab fears that someone would poison his meal and kill him, the official said that when Aftab arrived at the court for the first time, several lawyers had attacked him. Since then, he feels that he is not safe in the court.Interestingly, back in April last year, it was reported that Aftab’s jail inmates had thrashed him while being transported to Delhi’s Saket Court for the case hearing. The court had then ordered the jail administration to ensure Aftab’s safety.Furthermore, the lockup room officials said since the first day to this date Aftab has never expressed any regret over his horrific crime. They said that Aftab’s body language has remained the same since day one, he even believes that he would be acquitted. The officials also said that nobody comes to visit Aftab in jail, not even his family members.Speaking to Bhaskar, the Investigation Officer in the case Ram Singh said that until the filing of the chargesheet, he used to meet Aftab for one hour regularly for investigation in Mehrauli Jail. IO Singh said that Aftab has a tough mind adding that when Mumbai Police interrogated him for two days, Aftab did not reveal anything, “not even a word”.IO Singh further stated that Aftab is quite temperamental. He once said “Yes, I made a mistake. I did make a mistake, should I die now?”, however, he never explicitly regretted his actions.The investigation officer also said that apart from having a telephone conversation with his father once, Aftab has not been in touch with his family. Neither his family members come to meet him nor does he try to contact them.When asked about the delays in the case, advocate Seema Kushwaha said that even though the matter is being heard in a Fast-track court, it is not time-bound, thus there has been a delay in the filing of chargesheets and other procedures. She further pointed out that Aftab is “playing tricks”. Kushwaha said that Aftab has changed three lawyers so far in a year and now a new lawyer Akshay Bhandari is appearing for him. “Sometimes the accused uses various tactics to delay and divert the case. When a new lawyer comes he says that he needs time to read chargesheet etc…,” Kushwaha said adding that Aftab’s lawyers often miss the hearing.On November 14, the Delhi Police solved the six-month-old murder case of Shraddha Walkar and arrested Aftab Poonawalla for murdering her, and then chopping her into 35 small pieces. Aftab executed the murder on May 18 and stored her body parts in the refrigerator. He then disposed of the body pieces in Delhi’s Mehrauli forest during the next 18 days.The accused was arrested based on the complaint filed by Shraddha’s father on November 10. He stated in the complaint that the accused and the deceased had rented an apartment in Delhi and were staying in an unhealthy live-in relationship. He said that he had always opposed their relationship as Aftab used to physically assault Shraddha. The accused has been arrested and a case under IPC section 302 (murder) has been registered against him.The girl, a resident of Palghar, was adamant about continuing her relationship with accused Aftab and shifted to Delhi with him. Three days after they shifted to Delhi, they engaged in a quarrel and Aftab killed Shraddha. He confessed to his crime on November 14 and stated that they used to fight a lot. He said that he murdered Shraddha on May 18 as she was forcing him to get married to her. They also fought over who would manage the domestic household expenses.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
